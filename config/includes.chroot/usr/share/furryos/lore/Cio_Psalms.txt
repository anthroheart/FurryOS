Proalm 7S-t

A blackness sought, the night did see
An enigmatic and mysterious tree
A whisper silent with room ‘to grow
The infinite horizon, a longing to know
An empty mind, the devious thought
It is today, but once was not
A stone, alone, in empty space
Another floats to guide its pace

A power beyond, he once did see
One word gained, another set free
A watch to prowl, the capture fraught
To hold it can, a suspenseful thought
One can know the generous mind
He stares through again as if blind
Distance he sees is an empty heart
A painting so true can resemble this art

A thought he expects doesn’t do what it’s told
A sight that he sees can be hard to behold
The songs of peace are a wonderful word

The open sound, a dream to be heard
High up above, and endless cool light
Guiding the soul in the deadness of night
Your weakness is innocence, most undoubtedly so
A precious mind can describe where to go

He can understand, but will you not
A pain intense when his soul is bought
A challenge it is when the auction begins
The price is the pain, and so it begins
Try to stop and look back to the past
To when all time was one, but it never did last
Wish what you want, a gift can be yours
It is not too late for a key to the doors




--- Page 2 ---
The one who is wise is rarely wrong
Look for some time, and his presence is gone
Can you see through your mind to remember his face
He is not gone, the mind holds a trace
Go to dream and remember it well
Hear the music your mind has to tell
A spiritual flute can open the way
Follow the path, what words have to say

And at last, it will end, a journey of will
And for a moment time will stand still
Use it again, the emotional high
It all will come down to make anyone cry
Not a sad, but a happy time
All emotions at once to the top they will climb
So the end, it is said is a place
In his mind at his time you will see his face

You will know when you see
And darkness surrounds a peaceful tree.

Poalm 75-2

The Lord shineth down from Heaven
His light spread all throughout the Kingdom
Our hearts fill with joy and we celebrate
Our birth on the path to his holy land
A miracle in prayer or reading his Word
The wisdom he shares, a truthful fact
Lord, I hide not from your omniscient stare
I work my magic when I write to you.

Every sin was another drop spilled of your blood
And my wicked self put you to death
Your all knowing Word is the judge of me
It will come when the time is right
I will be ready to serve as before
I never want it to end

A stone tossed in a water so still

Its ripple proclaims your growing size
Contained in the souls of good to do your will.

Help me today to understand
The way to get it right
Knowledge not shared is a burning mind
Full of thoughts never going away
A sinful thought is a tempting desire
They are all one in the same
Never thee wait for my soul to change
A dead blackened night, your love helps me see
The time I never was right to thee
I am the tedious plan.

Let me see the infinite boundary
My sight was too near to myself
A self-devotion of one of many
I see myself as a possessor of bad
To repent is divine and long
The desire stands firm, a static form




--- Page 4 ---
My ears ring from the headache of lust
My eyes burn when I see only that
My hands itch from a deceitful greed
My lips sting from the kiss of passion
My legs hurt when I run from you.

All senses numb when we do not care
To follow your plan is your will of man
Let us know that our senses can work
When we take you into our hearts
Let us love one another always
Let us love you even more
A universal God in a cloud of mystery
I can love and relate to the mysterious God
For eternity we can share our love
Brothers and sisters we love too
For it means for the purpose of me

It will grow till the end of my life.

One can love a thousand ways
Love of God can count for all
But my sin has removed me from you
My body aches from this deceit
I try to pray a truth to you
But my stomach is ill from my acts
I am lost from your Word
When I pray I feel a certain way
I feel dizzy when I am done
Not sure if you listened or cared.

And all this will change on a wonderful day
A baptism in your name, a new disciple will come
The fruits of my labor for you will grow
Like a tree in the orchid of our lives
Your presence discerned the truth of your Word
From this Word I will grow in your church
Best be humble in my heart where I go
I can’t be sad on this joyful day
Because now I can live forever
And love you as long as the same.

You will fill me on this great day
And live in me through to my death
Your breath like the wind to carry my prayers
Let my faith not lead me to sin
A broken bone is less the pain
This I can’t bear to bring wrong to life
Thus I am born anew to your realm
Fill my heart with your humble name
To cure me of my evil way
And this will endure in me forever




--- Page 6 ---
Again I am scared when I look at me now
Satan keeps playing my song
I try not to hear but my will power is weak
I will strengthen this point and repent
Never to return to the old
Darkness still covers me, I need it to end
My life is in the hands of my maker
I humbly approach and ask for some time
And get my heart right to accept you
Lord, God, Almighty possess me forever!
True as one equals one I can say
Ill wager my life to prove
That Christ is the Lord of all
And he died for me a painful death
He rose again, this I know
I await for his coming again
But if it is possible at all:
“Can you delay until I am reborn?”
Please take this to heart like my own
I will pray that you lift me up. Amen.

Prala 1S -4

We are the children of God
Our family contained in the Church
Our love will hold us together
Our faith centered ‘round his Word
Let all become innocent again
A humble and noble heart
Knows the truth that lies within
To stay up late praising God
And wake soon to say prayers to Christ
Our life has most certainly changed.

Inside we all know our own truth
The state of heart that will decide
If it is time to be saved
The moments gone when time stands still
And God’s fury shakes across the land
All those who are saved will rejoice
Let us pray for this day
That those who are right are there
Only those who wish and believe can remain
Your sins must be paid for by Christ.

Let me be right, I wish and I hope
It is time to work for your Grace.
A price that we pay is commitment so true
We must give up all that he says
An eternity with him is worth some pain
That comes through missing some fun
Have you an idea how long eternity is?
Don’t just say “It’s forever!”
Forever does not tell you a true length of time
Because time does not exist in eternity.

A parable that I quote from a book quoted too:




--- Page 8 ---
“Tf there was a mountain of granite a mile high
and once every 10,000 years a bird flew past
and brushed its wing on the tip.

By the time the rock was completely eroded
A fraction of a second would have passed
In the context of eternity.”

This is too long to live without God
A second is too long as well you will know
As a true disciple of Christ
I would so choose despite troubles and dues
To follow and keep God’s law
Forever with God in a Kingdom so high
I will pay at all any cost
Sinful thoughts not to get in the way
His love will last forever
I will serve the winning side.




--- Page 9 ---
Proalm 75-5

The land where I walk is a narrow path
A lake stands alone on the side of the trail
The vast heaven opens, calling my name
Hear it I not as I keep my walk on
Perhaps I would know the truth for awhile
If I listened to the many Holy words.

Legends befall, but I miss the eternal
Not rightly so, I walk alone
Peace is my goal, a decisive task
When will I shed my being alone?
Patience I know, it is love that I seek
Sadly so, I am alone again.

Hear me my friend, much wisdom I share
Turn off your wicked ways
A death of one can save them all
Peace belongs to the one who believes
Hear the calls heaven shouts to you
Seek a kingdom of love forevermore.

Through sin you have blinded your eyes
Your ears hear unwise things
Your heart shows your state faithfully
Examine your heart and believe
God will save your weary soul
Trust in this to know its existence.

Many words have foretold the day
All will be seen for their worth
The heart is the key of glory
Fix your ways to mend the tear
Your faith stands lowly so
Increase this day your hope.




--- Page 10 ---
The rest will follow in time
The quiet now rests far behind
A peace will cover your life
Use it as God has said
Believe and his word will be yours
Let truth from most high be known.

The path is your life, look where it leads
A lake so big is your goal in life
Can be reached anywhere on the trail
Praise his life, his acts done well
For they were all done for some reason
And a reason that attributes to us.

Come to the light, as you’ve heard before
You can win on only one side
His presence is known, so follow
Listen to his words which he spoke
Do this quick while you can
You have nowhere else to go.

Pesala 7S-6

To break the hearts of a thousand men
It takes the will of God
To understand the Holy word
It requires nothing less
Many live in a frivolous way
Yet God’s glory is shown through the rest
Can we give any more to God?
Yes, let us surrender our dreams
All will shed a noble tear
On the day that God prepared
My still beating heart obeys his word
My evil side dead long ago
Saved ones rejoice from his spoken word
His promise, more real than we know
Forever he’s been and power defined
His ultimate good is blindingly so
Few can know his glorious plan
Only one of flesh and blood
In silence he patiently waits
At once he will come in an obvious way

Drop of blood to the ground, the moment’s come

All shall be judged by their faith
Wisdom defined when we see the light
A chance to walk by your side
Sin used to sever my hope and my life
Death will be harsh to the lost
Give praise while you can everyone!
Or weep forever for not
Keep his Holy name in your hearts
And hold his word on your lips.

Psalm 7S-7

Peace of mind, thy gentle stare
As a witness to all who live
Become at once the ideal man
Whose faith knows no limits or bounds
Through much pain the hope will endure
And knowledge will be sought even more
Love so strong to lift up the rest
And commitment beyond without doubt
Lessons each day will be shared and taught
There are far too many to count
Gods power beyond our simple minds
Our greatest thought but a whisper to him
Do not match wits with an all-knowing God
His basic thought will crush you in advance
Instead shout for joy for being a part of him
Glorify his name with at all any cost
Be proud to serve his glorious name
He will destroy the souls of the lost
If you do not come through in time
You hold a power that many can dream
The power to save is power indeed
Not to mention help from God himself
We praise his glory wholeheartedly
No one is as forgiving as he
Good so pure, a standard is set
We could not even fit into the scale
Our differences are way too immense
To compare extreme cases as these
Cry if you must, to feel his pain
And this will set you free.

Poala 75-8

A power decisive is nominally true
God’s great glory will never pass
Amazing sights will come into view
Give, he wants to, if you just ask

A prayer is bold in its unique act
Discipleship stands to the end of time
A troubled time will pass in fact
Be not too silent as is a mime

Quadrupled deluxe is his certain will
Beyond the scope of our best demands
Be not too steep to climb the hill
The everlasting time in a glass of sands

Be most noble in humbled way
Truth to be spread surely to all
Peace institutionally stated today
His word echoes softly down the hall

Trial based on our faith at stat
A humble approach for the grace
Dreaming of this time where you’re at
Be most humble to enter this place

See forever into the shiny night
His love glows bright with no dark
Simplified to ask us what is right
What we know contained in the ark

Citizens reproach to ask us why
Never to understand the will of Him
Away, far away, they pass us by
What they know, faint and darkly dim
Sad, not untrue, is their way of life
Outside God, what are they to do




--- Page 14 ---
Many a day, unknowingly strife
Everlasting peace to them to get through

Stay some time in a well known place

God, the majority rule, knows where

Not lift up, but low’ ring to this space
Look down on us to show you care

Of all things I know, your love is beyond
No comprehension can distinguish between
My mind waivers not from your strengthening bond
And your greatness will most surely be seen

Let us rise for his command
He is all that we care to pronounce
Choirs ring loud in his happy band
And we bow to his Holy countenance.

Poalm 7TS-9

The time succumbs, a new creation
The withered step beknownst
A flower stands in the misty rain
A part of this world, its own
A star afar in warm lullaby
In radiance it sings to sleep
Praise we give to the Creator
Knowing it all in a tiny seed
The presence is rightly assured
Peace began at time’s release
But change has come about
Shout of Joy, for that word is Jehovah
Dream of these holy names
Good tributation is the essence spared
Whether we know the truth
Our responsibility lies bare to the end
While truth is uncovered and known
Many will know but not care.

Proalm 75-10

One can know the simplest way
If they are near and far
Never to relate this way
To a gentle scene
They never know all there is
But what was once as true
Being there at any time
Is way past respect due
Product lies beneath the sea
But answers ride the wind
Whisper silent ever true
What do we need of you?
To learn for once it is
But by large has come apart
Resolved by tear streamed eyes
The emotional state is up along
Never faltering in its desiring task
But running through the stream
And all will come to rest
When what is paid as due
Sprinkles of a song will flutter by
And presents will fill the view.

Peale 7S-tt

The most difficult test to pass
Is not given a passing glance
It takes some time to understand
But learning past is helping well
Beyond even this lies much and many more
Endless events will be evidently present
God will bless the world with these all
So much more than we can know
Or even begin to comprehend
Learn to trust in his Divine ways
A good immeasurable will forever be
And has forever been
Sing of tribute to the past events
One such time was the best of time
Can you perfect such a complex task?
No, only Jesus was right!

He scored perfect on this task at hand
No one else has ever came close
Don’t despair, even so
God does not judge by score
Stated by fact is unduly true
Anyone wins who chooses to
Peace be with the unwavering soul
And give help to the wondering crowd
To do good things and be a big part
Be reborn, and learn the rest
Seek strong and you will find
Let God destroy your arrogant pride
And rebuild your stone cold heart
And you will know what’s coming to you
And earn what’s certainly due.

A window of opportunity awaits
Give your time and be prepared
Show no fear on this journey at hand
There are many rules of thumb
What is amazing to you?
Is it turning the sky from blue?
Not such is the limits of Him
Revelations states his minimum strength
Think of all he could do
Praises upon praises he is well due
Many a time we will wonder
Think hard, meditate strong
Always remember the love of Him
Respect his name, and glory is yours
Do what you wish, but beware!
Don’t overlook his goodness portrayed
But entrust yourself deep in his arms
He won’t let you fall if you have faith
He can catch a mountain at ease
So a man is no struggle for He
Learn a lesson each day
Train yourself to do what’s wise
Believe and don’t forget his words
Let Him set you free
A good Christian will be saved by Him!
Pure as a diamond, his good is clear
And his might could melt the same
Or crush it in his hand
And form again from blackened coal
To be worth more than a ton of gold.

A ruby he holds is intensely bright
His white light shines through this gem
A burst of energy to fill the night
With red and heavenly light

His arm could crush a star
Down to a golf ball size
A black hole created by him
Yet Earth remains in orbit

A million source codes by Him
Could be written without a thought
Way beyond our deepest dreams
And create a sentient machine

All books in the Great Library
Congress has a large selection
God has memorized very well
And can recite the very words

Dynamite and an atom bomb
Seem so powerful to man
Antimatter might be the next step
But supernovae are God’s simple breath

Poetry written, oh so grand
The melody flows through our mind
Let God write just a sentence or two
And put even Shakespeare to shame.

Sleep young one, you need your rest
Tomorrow will be a great day
Imagine for once a daring fight
But be calm as you lie tonight
You shall win before you start
As you can see, I truly care
Young soldier, I salute you
You are bold beyond compare
Your sword shall never be blown
Your grip of a marksman true
Worry not, I give you strength
To break a mighty staff
You are at peace forevermore.

Awake young one, for the battle begins
Unsheathe your sturdy blade
Prepare to fight and do not flee
The enemy will fall like flies
Go to battle this first time
Against a hundred men your size
The giants shun your land
Mighty! You will be called
And is well much your worth
Inherit the land that’s yours
And protect its boundaries far
Listen at end to what is said
“You’re journey has finally begun!”

See the fig on that great tree?
It is plump and ripe for harvest
Never go hungry while it has fruit
It is blessed for especially you
Knowledge will come in time
And strength will come at that end
Peace began when the seed was sown
It is as majestic as a throne
Jewels of moss surround its bark
The leaves are emerald green
The fruit resembles an obsidian stone
With a juice worth a thousand gold
Holy, you are blessed with its nectar
Jesus cursed another tree
Yet this one is standing firm
Not doomed for the fruit it bears
Time will pass and it will last
Never to begin to fade away
God has saved the best for last
Our past is gone in his eyes
Jesus’ blood cleared our fate
So enjoy the sweet fig as a break
Your life will be great when you are true
And sing to God, and give him praise
Dedicate this tree to his great might
Don’t force him to remove the fruit
He could uproot the tree with the greatest of ease
If his wrath were lasting
His good will prevail all time
And we can shout of joy
Give to God the fig of His
Present this offering of you
You can have what you want
But one tenth of His is to Him due.

Discipling in the noblest cause
Repentance starts within
Know the Word to sing His grace
Portrayed in everlasting love
Respect the humble nature
Let it change your life again
Be hot for God and His sweet son
Behold the sovereign eternal name
Beauty majestic stands for us
Let us visit this great place
Before we spend eternal life
In a beauty way beyond
A nature of thy very self
States to all who care
Show yourself for who you are
Don’t turn away with pride
Or from the cause of fright
Everyone is scared at a time or next
And yet they follow through
Sing your dreams aloud at once
Praises know the Father’s place
His address is surely known
All colors blend together as one
Sure as good is His pure light
A story of will to prove His might
And a death to show his love
Praises again to His holy name
Which we shall forever give.

Love of disciples is surely true
One to hold in awe
Never on the earth compares
Any commitment so true
Believe and be helped
Among our family’s love
Trained or not it still is fair
And skill will come in time
Idols cast will not be known
The fire burns them up
On warm summer days we steadily stand
The moon intense shines through the night
Complexity found in the simplest terms
Trials of might to cross the day
Candlelight sifts through a night
When dusk was really born
A friend was really born
But one was pure enough
Love enough, by Him a standard set
Almighty servant high and low
Salvation earned when He died
Peace was bought at His great price
Tired our souls for the vicious fight
But rest has made us strong.

River, stream, or grandest scheme
Glory of a stone shedded space
Wall of knowledge to pass beyond
Apex of an omniscient high
Time a number surely smoke
Intrinsic detail of bottom spent
Plasmatic neutral of fiery light
Lucid blind to earn the prize
Seemingly so liquefied breath
Nor of inferior insight
Calm in retrospect is to comprehend
Black to pale becomes his sight
Whistle of nature mountain range
Harmony resonates of Heavenly choir
To shatter down the bitterness
Proximity close the paradox nil
Sleepily is the sound in head
Think to show your faithfulness
Dream the countenance of law
Follow decrees of His devise
Exhausted eyes can read His sign
Unhearing men still understand
Sleep well for tomorrow’s work
And grow from stopping sin.

A man tried to enter the kingdom of God
But he found all the doors were locked
Never did he understand
The reason for his dying heart
He could write psalms at five a day
But was it deep from his heart?

To scratch the surface, he could in simple terms
He wanted to spread his many words
But again all the doors were locked
He never depended on money from you
Yet never stood firm in his faith
A special presence of Divine truth
But his mind was void of grace
Slowly he grew from his lacking ways
His heart began to move at last
He could speak and for once be heard
He knew, for the obviousity of it was clear

Closer he grew and warmer he felt
Friends to help his mind to learn
The grandest Book of all
Preciousness sought in dearest terms
Never will he claim he forgot
Slowing down, the high has gone
Now his uniform increase
For the greatest moment of all
When he was baptized into Christ.

A simple day has come about
The great Son has come for us
This will be true one day
Such peace we have not had
Glory be to him who cares
And such is to compare
The precious lamb to be foretold
Bringing the seals of the Day
Judgment swift and rightly so
Belonging to this One
Gnashing of teeth will many do
But disciples will shout amen!
Worldly thoughts to pass away
Our deeds for once are done
Righteous known to praise the Lord
Heaven will sing of His grace
Do you work as He did say
And fortify your soul
Guarantee your salvation of His
And keep in mind his pain
Now he lives by God’s great side
And we will join his fame
Quest be done, the fruit thus borne
Many were saved by Him
Train your mind to do the job
And respect his toils again
To Him be the knowledge and praise
Let it do Him rightly so.

Time decides the deciduous task
Arranged in a pattern of life
Everlasting peace and everlasting glory
Are still the prime of it
Praises whistled proud and true
Become the priceless night
Song of whisper sounding soon
Amongst the flower room
Beauty is known when it is called
And understood beyond any doubt
Believing in the unseen power
And yet it involves us all
Never forgot the decisive task
Never know it for ourselves
But remembering His acts done well
We never cease to be amazed
The glory is shown to us still now
And we never forgot His holy face
Sad and true, He felt through life
Closer to God than we realize
Never a doubt in His mind was spared
Holding on to His fabric of faith
Come let us celebrate on this day
Remember His love of us
Tonight will be celebration due
And best wishes will be known to you
Follow in this path He walked
And slowly learn His views
Read again His expressive face
And hear about His good news.

The mustard seed meek and small
Jesus’ faith rested on this
Dust in size to complicate
This and the gentle mind
Glory held in highest place
News among to commentate
Spread to all nations around
The fields will grow from abound
A harvest ripe is so dear
Planted with care in mind
Seek this fruit with careful heart
And learn about his ways
Sit and dream and think it through
A Christian man's point of view
Be quick to hear the many words
Spoke through faith and skill
Deliver your speech when time has come
Be impressed on how far you've come
And give God's glory what is Him due
Apostle's creed was learned by few
So much to be said by still less few
| God worked miraculous signs
: And Heaven worked the best of times
Our heart is way past due
It is time to change our minds from old
Grow to believe, if not anymore
) You will become what you want to
Because God's eyes see the best for you
| And you will always think
And be relieved that he sought you through.

King of all to give him with
Not to take it with a grain of salt
Disbelief has gone astray
And entropy has left far behind
Straight is the path beyond our sight
Yet obstacles will come about
Faith in God will help us fight
The many demons that will come up there
Ahead of us lies difficult tasks
Yet with God none will be in vain
Every decision from in your life
Will be based on your trust in faith
Sure as the sun will rise again
He is our Lord and Savior true
The one and only doer of good
For what good means to God
Purity at heart we need to stand
Sure in the face of fate
Bold beyond our darkest nights
Through to be sure to the end
God, to fear, is a definite must
Satan be blown down by the wind
Flee from us, he will upright
Destroyer of souls is lost
Confusion sets in on his part
From our not wavering from our love
Decisions so firm of conviction
One can bet anything at all
Trials of fire to test our might
Our spiritual life will live to tell.

A raven defines the cold dark night
The monotone safe and surely so
Ride from the wind the sacred word
Entwined in the river in which it flows
Life-giving blood from the sacred act
Sins all washed away from birth
Peace at calm from the crickets chirp
The purity in form resonates the sky
Separate for once from all knowing eyes
His heart broke full of our evil shame
Part away from a Father he trusts
Sweat burned dark upon his brow
Painful thorn upon the noble crown
The dark knit skies were drown
Sour rain did once pour down
Fell at the feet of the stumbling crowd
Fear became thick and wholly known
Faint remembrance the only emotion
What we all did want was done

Complete to the end, the scriptures fulfilled
Priceless price paid in full
Jesus gained much when he lost his life
He died for the noblest cause
Washed in our redeemers blood
The wicked at once did fall
His spirit lives through the time
Burnt in our minds his deeds done good
Glued to our hearts his softening grace
Raven did carry the message to all
Lord God a noble act perfectly done.

A leader is known from the sound of his voice
And conviction which is deep from his heart
He knows by heart the Book of Words
And claims it is what he’s supposed to do
He accepts despite the time laden task
He will teach any lesson to you
Evangelists form a high one indeed
Wisdom is formed from experience gained
And they sure rank high on this list
Seasons lived by a hundred or few
Solemnly shown by their ways
They never seem to have a doubt
Their eyes behold their truth
Disbelief of them has left astray
Their minds begin to think
So you say and so you shall
Became the same each night
Simply shown to those who wish to know
A presence silent begins to be
Sweet innocence will rule over all
The child will come to lead
Unfaltering in his silent steps
He waits quietly for the right time
Never wasted for any grief
They cheer in hopes to be heard
Silent night and lullaby
Their hopes shall be the seed
Food to the thousand is sought
Breaking the silence to let us find
It is right to understand this so
Let his mind try to be taught
And listen to our silent words.

Drummer upon a misty hill
The thump a sound of sadness
Melody soft and ever slow
Walking alone on a drizzling night
Animals run some distance away
An emotion so strong can be heard
Praying by day to earn a friend
Solemnly continues to beat the drum
Wind rushes through his wiry hair
To brush so softly the fur
Never upon his dreams at night
Did he ever know a friend
God watches over such as these
He’s patient in our anticipation
He knows what to make of a situation
Any calm day or windy night
Will be a safe one with Him
Looking toward the stars one night
The man thought of deep desires
He laid down his drum and called out
And God listens to such as these
Prayers work with ingredient of faith
No doubt in your heart must be sure
Signs will tell when they come true
The drummer had always come through
And now he believed and so was spared
His dread of being alone was gone
A friend came to him bravely so
Invited to a church of warmth and love
His grace became most in his life
His spirit was strong and free
And God stood gracefully by his side.

The seed will bear the ripened fruit
Once a month it will freshly bear
Disciples will celebrate at each event
And surely so another follower of God
Wicked men smashed back into dust
The place they go is where they’re from
God works perfect in miraculous ways
He will know our deceitful acts
Slowly contemplate on His name
And remember His great power over all
If anyone was to say that they know all
They are deceiving themselves for sure
For that phrase too commonly spread

“The more you know, the more you realize what you don’t know”

And that holds true even in the gospel sense
But worry not, for this is Gods work
Only He should concern Himself with knowing all
No one could handle to know such as Him
One would most certainly lose their mind
So stand in awe instead by Him
His glory will stand the best all time
Give Him the gold medal before you start
Do not compete against Him
Common sense you will say
But do you mean it or know?
Just beware what you say and do
And live for his purpose and do as you’re told
And God will look after you
Just as he did in Moses’ time
For the same God of Moses
Is the God of you and I.

A sport to be played at day
The grass fresh cut smells so
Wind ever cool upon your back
And sun shines ever so warm
Slowly he judges the distance
Tt seems much farther away
If Jesus were still alive today
I’m sure he’d play the game
Time no waste, the crowd grows still
And the man lines up to play
A moments thought in his mind
He shakes the dew from his feet
Looks to the sky to pray to God
To make this hole in one
Faith assured in his sense
For then is all that is known
Slowly brings back his powerful club
Selected right from the start
Pressure on, courageous most sure
The peers stare at his face
Brings it right down after a moments pause
Confident enough for his will
Confidence such as this will succeed
God gives much to these
Pray to Him through any task
Any deed, any act you wish
So then came the ball on down
On toward its very small goal
| Holding of breath for the instant
His score became less one.

Give praise of guitar to Him
Sweet melody chimes in tune
Our thoughts together as one
Same topic is spread around
Concern remains the same
Trials are won at this time
Harmony drifts through the night
Swiftly calmly ever so
Drizzle upon the starry night
Moonlight shines softly down
Look to the sky as you play
Strum the mighty strings
Many notes will come about
And all will definitely be heard
Pleasant sound to God’s ears
He yearns for you to play
Join the heavenly band of His
And share about his grace
Complex hands will make the sound
Whispers will speak the words
Rhyme will be evident to all who care
Listen well to the sound of night
Mellow tunes upon the air
Many more will play the same time
Fellowship with God this way
It relates to Him the best
A precious moment is done this way
He hears every word in song
And knows what you’ ll speak next
Be patient to get to the end of song
Don’t rush to get by fast
God rewards those who wait.

To a date that is well prepared
Planned out detailed to the end
Rushed not through these times
Righteousness remains in there
Grassy plain, a well picked spot
Much food was packed with care
And throughout all this time
God remains the first in mind
And our date we will well serve
To, by, and from anywhere
A week in advance it was begun
The thought of what to do
Convicted to a definite end
Nothing comes up to interfere
The double will keep on track
And keep it fun to all
A step at a time is the key
And always lift them up
Praise and encourage them
Be fired up this day
The world knows not how amazed
We are of our blessing from God
Grass green of a pure hue
Fresh air for breathing free
Calm at this time are all
All worries dropped from view
Concentrating on only now
Praying for minutes together
Beauty majestic is splendid
Remember what He did for you.

College to share our faith
School to evangelize
Work to bring to church
Home to set an example
On the street to seek the lost
The market to let them know
The game to relate to them
Seminar to fellowship
Bible talk to read the Word
Library to learn about other religions
Meditate to absorb what was said
Church to learn a lesson
In your car to pray to God
All alone a quiet time
On a date to serve
On the bus again to relate
In the park for a peaceful time with God
In the mountains to know His strength
In space to know His size
Underwater to know his reach
With a disciple to confess your sin
With the sword to open your heart
With a calendar to count the days
With a cross to know His heart
With bread to feed the poor
With wine to drink a toast
Everywhere pertains to God
But one place He is not found
Your duty to seek the lost
If God is first in your life.

Disciples journey goes on
To walk a hundred miles
For a bible talk with few
Knowledge that must be shared
Souls depend on this bread
Teaching to understand the Word
What you’ ve learned belongs to all
Peace be with those like these
Distance is not a factor
No conditions placed on faith
For wisdom should continue to grow
Sermons delivered in hopes to be
A changing motive in life
As sure as one loves the next
As God has loved us so
Tired eyes will fade away
Excuses have long since passed
Sleeping only to get strength back
Our waking time can save their souls
God uses us in amazing ways
Let us march together as one
And spread this peace around
Let not God’s wrath remain on us
So listen to what is told
Use our talents any way we should
God gave them to us for a reason
All brothers and sisters as one
Can work any possible task
If we remain all unified
There is no task that can’t be done.

God gives land we inherit
Wars broke out among many for it
Many deaths were involved
Peace has finally come
Easy is our time right now
We do much less than before
Survival takes a simple job
Before you worked hard to live
Lord, don’t let us grow lazy
Don’t let us live just for day
Let us live on the edge
Risks make the world go round
Many take for granted their blessings
Some don’t care for the poor
The world is an unmistakable mess
Violence is presently clear
Sad times indeed, but not as before
Steal if they must, and some do for fun
Crimes by day occur all too often
Lord, look upon this corrupt world
The nations don’t get along
From Babel our tongues were spread
Yet let us unite again as one
A challenge you give us which means so much
So powerful, so perfect, so precise
Time is in essence in your control
We grow old and deny our mistakes
And we tend to think we’re the best
But in heart we grow weary by more
Too simple our context of thought
Trained not for a battle field
Our souls are in danger at this
If we choose not at all to care
We are more lucky than we know
Blessed most surely so
Don’t take for granted what He’s done

His love has made us well
Imagine once the way it was
And now how easy it is
No cars were present back then
Through hot desert they boldly walked
No telephones to call to meet
Send a messenger to the ends of town
No computer to type their books
Had to write and correct their mistakes
Nor flowing water in their homes
Hot water would be a luxury
No stereos to listen to music again
Had to go to listen to live
No glasses to correct vision
If you couldn’t see, it was bad
No security systems for your home
Fearing at night of a prowler
No AC or electricity
Water to cool, candle to light
At least there were no ICBM’s
Yet swords would surely hurt more up close
Just remember how easy we have it
And how hard it was back then
Let us not grow to be weak at heart.

Proalm 75-54

A brave little fox sits alone;
Independent and on his own.
A sign of truth and power,
A peaceful dark and silent thunder shower.
Venture on, yes he must;
A bitter-sweet trail of musky dust.
Hush; his thoughts grow loud;

A remote speck of wonder increasing the sound.
Forward he goes, toward a distant plain;
Content is his will; a mighty creature is trained.
Dark amongst the horizon sits still;

A lone tree and cool winds of a chill.

A moments thought, in his world of concern;
Such a tree, powerfully, and knowledge to learn.
From there Lone Fox moves on;

Steered by the dreams, and memories, as one.
He never stands still, how ambitious he is;

A worthy creature he knows, a small world is his.

At first light he can see where his dreams told him to be;
A plateau it is, not what his mind at dark let him see.
So high up near the clouds lies the levelest grounds;

It's his quest to go on, the one who bested the hounds.
Up he climbs with incredible pace;

He roughens his grip, and licks his dusty face.
No rocks tumble down, protected by God.
This cliff is his; he's mastered its ways.

It is dusk at the top while he waits;

He needs rest, he is weak, and his little heart aches.
Adventure is he, for he knows it quite well;

His ears perk and he looks at the sky when I yell.
He is part of me as I am of him;

A final call, it grows dark, and my heart grows dim.




--- Page 42 ---
There he lies, a symmetrical dream;
His emotions flow through in a stream.
Up on his hill, he bravely remains;
He knows your emotions are locked up in chains.
Lone Fox is the one who is free;
Are you not? He knows why you can't be.
He is free for facing his fears at a near,

He has won and it shows in a single bold tear.
He has followed his hopes and his dreams far along;
At ease he can rest, and wonder, and sing the sweet song.
A dream, a memory, only he knows the way;
Remember a tree; knowledge learned in a day.
Forever he's kept this moment alive;
Uncertain he is, how much more he must strive.
His goal has been met, so he helps us get through;
A wish, a wonder, he'll let be done by you.

Just listen for this peace that grows true in all;
The wise tree grows on top, a soft wind is its call.

This psalm is meant to be poetic. It shows that if God is willing to help
even a fox, who knows how much He would be willing to help us. God
helps us get through. A fox is just a symbol in this poem of a
persevering man, yet fox sounds more poetic. Indeed, God gave all the
strengths to this character, for no one would be anything without God.

Starry night the solemn skies
Only one who told the lies
Nervousness is all around

So thick being the only sound
Try not and don’t despair

What you do may not seem fair
But it is, and was picked well
Listen to what God has to tell

Be at work in your heart
Truly sing of your noble art

Share the words in your mind

Try to ask and seek to find
Think at a time when you dream
Flowing smooth a running stream
Remember God for His mighty task
In His love where all should bask
See the glory He has prepared
Jesus died to show He cared
Only one to worship so

Lord so high, and servant low

Program set upon His head.
Truly so, Gethsemane dread
Beyond endless scale was his love
Ever more than we were dreaming of
Fighting might was not at need
Jesus died, we should take heed
Willing to serve his precious life
Never took upon a wife
Spread His glory around the earth
Living lowly and lowly birth.

Let me think for a moment’s thought
What of God should I write
Is His glory too much to describe
How about His might
His purity seems rather strong
His love cannot be said in words
The good of Him is immeasurable
His patience is practically eternal
His trust of us is too much
His promptness is perfect
When to punish the wrong
Fear of Him, we really must
Let Him name us to His decision
Seemingly quiet never so
He will tell you what to do
Blessed peace in blessedness
A plethora of words for all
Emptiness never known to Him
Sing of places great and small
Wicked to soon perish
The good to inherit the earth
Diseases to wipe out the weary
The poor made strong in faith
God looks upon these times
Our future is His main focus
Will we be leaders in the test of time
God chose us to, to serve His Name
And one religion will dominate
The rest will dissolve from sight
Only one who seeks His Word be spared.

How many days to come
Until your final day will be
Here we wait with curiosity

Our destination already known
So we work as much as we can
To serve while we’re still here
Little time will still remain
Until our jobs are done
Do not sit and mess around
Uncaring minds are not of use
Thoughtful souls to do the work
Painful memories to motivate
Treasure the time we have
Give to them what He gave us
Present our transient bodies
Before we live in eternal soul
Carry the cross each day

We must suffer in this way

A plan that’s almost complete
Mostly over but needs yet more
Dress for the Day not casually
As you would on the normal day

Bright and everlasting light

Consumes the wretched souls
Cast them down to great depths
Let the rest rise up this high
Calendar followed every day
Every week to start anew
Don’t concern yourself on when
Not even Jesus could answer that.

To try to sort things through
Discipling time with discipler
A time for mending you
Bible talk is planned out well
The subject pertains to all
Every day we find a fact
And the Bible describes why
Sharing notes, ideas, and minds
We learn the lesson from them
Turn from wrong that made us cry
Believe the never-ending words
Challenge strong we will confer
In the church we all will learn
Valuable lessons presented by day
Every time that we can meet
Shatters my heart from my deceit
I am broken sound and true
I tell this message to you
Never stop for any aim
Challenge works from any point of view
Sin has fled from a noble man’s heart
And left him gratefully alone
For fellowship of highest accord
We meet in godly, grateful terms
Never a procrastinating man
Shall ever move a stone
Deliver us Christ’s holy words
And firm us in our faith.

Soft magic fills the air
When Jesus begins to speak
All is silent in the land
For to hear His parables
Wisdom is known by Him
He’s had since the beginning of time
A speck of dust our knowledge is
Yet His words are a mountain range
Humble He is before us all
As we should be before Him
Do not wait to change your life
Any acts, to think if good
Move to the better life
And serve God as your own
It seems too common to be
Yet He is worthy nonetheless
Teams to cheer on His side
And praise to call His name
Shout and root for Him
Dusty crown upon His head
He has won everything He plays
Worship bright and always true
Patience pays to the end
Lonely times are gone at last
At last we have a friend
No one should still be lacking in faith
Yet any troubling times
We all remember His ways.

Patient and reverent friend
Most noble if to hear
Spending time upon the earth
Away from His holy Father
Separate only once but so
Dance for joy tonight
Do not fell tired or despair
No depression lives for long
Cheer up our saddened souls
And feel humble most of all
Love Him as you love yourself
But more as He is most
The universe but a speck to Him
All animals upon the earth
Will bow and shout to Him
People as well as them
Will humble up real soon
Waste no time to do your work
Do not live the same all day
Check your work to make it sure
If it’s right, you have done well
And if not to try again
For not many won the first
But many tries will succeed
Try to finish where you left off
Since God has done the same
He should expect nothing less of you
Because you do what he told you to do.

I sit and wait in expectation
The time is about to come
The meeting place was surely set
And promptness pays respect due
It all would work in a perfect world
But God makes no mistakes
he set this world apart from His own
So each would have its own ideals
God gives talents as He sees fit
So all are not the same
He intercepts on our behalf
What He does sure does us good
He will serve us faithfully
He will use us trustfully
And love us all wholeheartedly
Plans He’s made, His point of view
Let us not forget His grace
For none should see demise
Give to us our daily bread
And keep our health well fit
To bask in the eternal sun
Warmth to calm our spirits
We exist in God’s creation
We hear the sounds of Him
We can taste the pure water
And feel its coolness through
And to smell His lovely flowers
And see his beautiful sights
To feel all these in our hearts’ mind
We should know what He can do.

I have worried day and night
I am tempted through and through
I try to resist, and it is strong
My faith needs to surely grow
I give in too quick to sin
Right away as I seem to do
My heart is not with me then
I mourn after it is done
But it does no good for my soul
Yet I catch myself in the middle
And I stop before I go too far
Yet this happens when I am clear
When my mind has no doubts at all
I only gain headaches from my acts
Not a bit of good was done
My eyes were stung from a thought
My stomach has turned bitter
Yet why am I so careless?
Why do J do deceit?

We all need encouragement
But we need to call our friends
Don’t just depend on their faith
You need to persevere for help

Let us train our minds God’s way
Let us read and absorb His word
Fill our minds with curiosity
And use it for good it bears
Don’t try to go for just length
But quality much as the same
Do not listen just to yourself
But seek help in God’s holy book
Brothers and sisters can rejoice
When they help a person in need
Together we can be united
In truthfulness and faith
And love each other the same.

In school he studies hard
To learn a lively chore
He wants to rest for all
Yet he knows he must move on
Flipping through the pages
Learning one word at a time
He seems content at his pace
No concern at his heavy work
Even he needs God in his life
Faith is the key to success
If he wants at all to win
God must be in his heart
He could sleep more instead
But his work seem priority one
Do not put this before God
Because He will surely be mad
But hasten not all at now
God has patience without bounds
So God chose him out of the crowd
So many to choose it was him
He didn’t know this gift at first
But to realize what was in him
Think about the future
Not of the time at hand
In time you will be a leader
Your knowledge will help you out
But use your talents for God
Don’t waste his present to you
Be holy and give it your all
Be sure of it wherever you go.

Warm burning feeling so
Good day best of all
Singing on a clear day
Nights before rained down
Wet still is present around
For church a blessing was found
No matter if something comes up
We still meet to share our lives
To learn about Jesus Christ
Peacefully we take communion
To remember His great love
Close our eyes in silence
And reminisce on His life
Pain has left us long ago
We do not live the world
Spiritual in a noble sense
Is portrayed in majestic word
Ponder on this simple task
So complex to those not there
To take the burden of eternal life
To deny their very self
Too hard for some yes some
Others will gain the truth
Faith will ever be grown
Tonight the clear sky

And Gods word floods the night
Peace be forever all and all amen.

To put it another way you can't
Only one answer can really exist
God's word answers all questions complete
He works in miraculous ways
His deeds just can't be explained
It all works out to a perfect tone
Friends will share the adventure
Blessed are those who understand
The Name on High is known
Spread around of their afterlife
The truth for all to know
Speedy recovery with God's heart
With crying eyes in our thanks
Blessed be God for incredible love
Let it not come to rest undone
Work so hard as to glorify

His name is much worth the praise
Responsibility entrusted in his worth
Let Him save our weary souls
Partake in His great adventure
Shout amen to the Great | Am
Peace to them who sacrifice
Church never spent in vain
Questions asked in deep concern
Opportunities come in glow
Living with others who know your faith
To rebuke and correct our life
Censored not our hearts within
To shed a gentle tear
Apologize not to just repent
Imperfection for not being Him.

The child within us all
Wants to be a part
Release the innocence
Portray his waking glance
Stand by to accept the truth
Remain and understand
The glory is set loose
To land upon those men
To care and surely divine
Peace in open space
Tensions released from captive
Restlessness flows far away
Calmly spread around the earth
Holy is in words abound
Treasure from His living space
‘God lives all around
All is His by Him
He shares it with the rest
All we know and all we care
Are but a piece of His
Resistance gone in the mist
Visions come into view
Knowing the truth is real
More real than we should know
: Don’t cover up your shy remarks
To let it grow inside
Humble yourself against your pride
And go against the grain
Troubled times aren’t desperate times
Some ways are better that some
Trust in your heart to not expend
Your heart is glad you did.

Appreciate thy noble deeds
Respect our work most done
Fun was not the ingredient
But effort paid the price
God has showed us mercy
To tire not from our task
Day and night full of might
Sweat was at large relevant
Faith in the good that follows
To put forth such incredible time
Noble in character is to show
Our efforts have won at last
We have taken first place
Way above the second in line
Suffering so much from our tries
But rest comes in the end
Labor dedicated to Almighty God
Time not meant for us
Borrowed from Him so humbly
He lent with cheerful eyes
Heart warmed at the sight
Of the finished task
Again it was worth the endeavor
Great minds do think alike
Behold the product expectantly
See the riches flowing forth
As time has come for me to tell
A great disciple has come about
Don’t give up when times are tough
God rewards those who persevere.

Stars brightly shine in the sky
Did another man humbly die?
Christ he worked for in honor
But saving souls was wonder
Amazing times brought to view
Many men will wonder who
Deeds be ever so swiftly done
Dedicated to the heavenly Son
Hungry for the bountiful goal
What is it that makes this goal?

Is it times and deeds done enough
To speak in jargon and mumbling stuff
To confuse the simple mind
Our love in Christ will bind
Pictures will show our deepest thoughts
Trees growing from the planted pots
Church as a body is as one
Never to ask which way we have gone
Past is behind us long ago
Never to be full of feeling woe
Joy is in essence around
Our faith is most safely sound
Trusting in which we do not see
Most boldly where we care to be
Existing for a very short time
Sentimental worth a dime
Thirsty we wait for the drink
A chain we are a part a link
Salvation came with His blood spent
Heaven is from and where He went
Time is shorter than we can dream
To float down a heavenly stream.

How long will we wait oh Lord
Patience is needed by you
Give us the strength we need
To choose the path least trot
Signals have come and gone
Opportunities are bountiful things
Jewels from the heart of who cares
Jesus’ great name shows us why
Noble He be, in His great name
Need not reveal your glory to us
Faith has assured us of your belief
In us a power is boldly placed
Fire still in the night
Warmth emits from its glow
Staring into its churning vibes
Distilled by the facts of life
Tones echo without bounds
Rain drop mist on the ground
Dew rich earth to soak the place
And christen the soft lullaby
Troubled times are floating by
Streams of echoes and wonder
The Lord lets us know of this fact
His worth declares it more than that
Trees see the moisture so dear
Tears to wash our feet
Clear from dust laid streets
Our home has long been found
Entrusted in His majestic throne
Supported by His arm
Given into His deeds aplenty
Solely He did humbly go
Walking alone in His time
No one around His self
His moment has passed that once




--- Page 60 ---
And He has ever been last
But now His time has come
To wonder, too strange to become
What we are, look at us now
Look deep into what we are made of
Clay in rich pots of His creation
Universe falls all around
See the meekly inherit the world
Before the new dawn has come
Never to end the rich laid task
Forever to persevere
Chase away the lust craved freak
Not of God, a crazy mutation
Saddened hearts still wonder
Did He do all He chose?

The man marches on voice asunder
The moon lit night to be under
Light of mint to know
Slow down His beating heart
Hush, let the noise grow down
To reach a gentle pace
And walk in helping grace
And remember the God marches forth
To defend to honor His trust
Trails of past defeats
Victory now before His feet
Walk to now pray in peace
The past has made us free
Never concern yourself with bad
To only die in greed.

Who can be God’s best friend?
Is he like man’s best friend, the dog?
Is he loyal and obedient and humble?

Does he make mistakes and learn?
How many times must he try
To learn to get it right?

He never could know wrong ways
Innocence never left since birth
All can see what is meant
As parables spread His words
Dream of yourself like that
Encourage the truthful thing
Consider what else could be
To learn and share the wisdom
Again God’s friend is certain
A friend much like a son
And others included as well
Christians do His purpose
Set their lives as an example
To choose the right way path
And not stray from righteousness
And when one starts to slip
And finds himself deep within
Pull him out with your arm
Hold up to your expectation
And show us your faith aloud
Singing, smiling, surely so
Trust in our way of life
A friend of God can know his worth
For many come but few become
See this point and take a note
To Him, a friend to be.

Silent minds in thought down under
We wait for their decision
Not for the here and now
But much more and ever later
Teaming with the good side
To relinquish our bad side
To earn the most noble honor
To accept the fate defined
Sample the grain of trust
It begins a smallest speck
To grow to a mountain of righteousness
And form a world of love
Stand your ground and expect
The force will come on strong
Arm yourself against this foe
Not to wonder, waiver, or die
Shame not known to believers
And failure means more next time
Perfection never to be reached
Yet close we can become
Jesus is love in the flesh
It is him we live for now
Forever we sing Hallelujah
And bow to His great might
Living for the eternal Day
Our past a speck in time
Nobleness has sought us through
To respect His character
Believe and work for grace
Train you mind as thus
Persevere in your open heart
To be great and follow Christ.

Taming the discerned mind
Track the wild steps
Know the strangest tone
Speak with distilled words
Relate not to recycled intuition
But humbling increased by fold
Whole in part is willing
To trace the modest scheme
Further we come to understand
God’s good grace on our behalf
Stringent times have fallen around
Abroad our actions are heard
Done with the winds demise
To talk about winning this side
Trained in unmentionable ways
Too complex to understand alone
Teachers reveal the mysteries
Behold, the Bible, the Law
Great is the fact of man
Greater still is a Heavenly dream
Power understood by the few
Only some may taste this truth
Seemingly so not self-centered
To be one with the rest
Satellites will disappear
And flood to the crowd lit prize
Spoken before in his humble sense
Enough has been said for us
To know our deeds and actions
To unfold before His great eyes
Monotony gone from the past
Uniqueness presents itself
Each individual pays respects
And timely said to be done soon
And He has spoke the wisdom.

Concern yourself in a task
To persevere through a difficult chore
But a joy it is at the end
To say the work was yours
God watches over such as these
To help the needy men
When He asks us for some time
To mend the broken hearts
Not too tough for our hands
Our minds push through the path
Our hearts revealed in a powerful way
The same is done elsewhere
To speak of our current dreams
To act as a disciple of Christ
To mean ever word ever uttered
To explain in depth your words
Spice to light up the times
Revealing their hardened hearts
Explained in a pattern of facts
Humbling out when asked to do
But initiation is fantastic indeed
To come and do before you’ re told
Shame will not befall on you
If you obey these creeds
Yet not just as opinions or thoughts
But as facts, more real than any
Despair won’t come at all time
But to strengthen our bonds with each
So ask yourself these questions
And take a humble stance
Answer faithfully and sure
Be true to yourself at least
And God will reward you in full
Do more than just believe.

I see God’s symbol to be
Gentle and meek is He
He yearns to set us free
He rules alone, we can join in
He fights for His mighty words
The world is His own
With grace so true
And peace abounds
His truth can make us cry
His words stand firm, in fact
There is only one God for sure
Nothing can bring Him down
With His power, he makes an impact
It works with His incredible wisdom
His sense of omniscience is beyond all
He will prevail in any task
Don’t wrong Him at all
And a strong Holy spirit as well
We all know where He remains
He can outdo anyone
No pursuers or those who flee are safe
He knows how to live and well
All year long He rules
There is still only One
Never to be killed or stopped
To give to us His choice
Not owned by anyone
Yet He rules over us
Give respects to His illustrious name
And all hail his incredible peace.

All people of the world
Can share a valuable gift
A magnificent empowerment
Of this mystical skill is
A willingness to learn how it works
Not just how, but all points of view
We make unnatural mistakes
But to correct is the desire of all
A craving, a need of all to do things well
But first you must understand the path
You must embrace this power to find your way
Through a path split a billion fold
A complex strand is simple enough
When compared with a challenge of skills
Once you learn this skill
You will know what all is
And so too with each and every one of all
Yes, all can learn the way,
Just start at the beginning of what is seen
The Word is where to start
It is the basic builder of all
Life of all begins at the Word
So all are linked to this truth.

The code of life is the stranded path
Only one can teach all to get through
So follow this skill from the Word
And at the end will be found
That the basic strand ends at the end of the Word

And life goes on towards death
All the facts are important
And they all keep all correct
Review the details of the Word
And magnify them so all can see
The importance of this Book
We zoom out to a broader view




--- Page 67 ---
And our skill becomes clear
From the truth that can be seen
But to know what it is
We must understand ourselves
For He pertains to all

The Word is our skill, we should accept it
In order to progress anymore
Follow Him or we may lose
The ability to find ways through our lives
The Word He presents
Is just as important as this
And without this we don’t learn
And knowledge is not shared at all

Skill is a factor of knowledge
So knowledge not shared is a skill lost
And with no skill, all will be lost
But time will not wait for
Skill to be found again
So take the Word while you can
And we will have no trouble at all
Are you curious to know who He is?
Well search your soul for Him
Because everyone knows deep in their heart.

Never-ending raindrops on your furry head
Make you wonder why it's cold
A breeze throughout a dense foggy night
A warmth you feel, but only in your heart
The wind combs your fur making you think
You fear the freezing rain and storm
The musky scent is drowned out wet
The soaked fox remaining sad.

Is he not alone, does God support him?
Of course, his needs are met aloud
"But not tonight," he says himself.

His memories are seldom seen
Perhaps this explains his depression.
If there was one to be loved
Can he safely say it was he?

"Continue," he says, "Do not leave me like this."
His words are heard and make me care.
Be brave, and strong, you'll get through the night
Just as everyone has, a truth in fact.
Do you worship the sun, to give you warmth?
And take away the freezing rain.
"T do," the fox says, "Get me through the night."

So on I go, giving courage to him
And at last his depression has gone.
Do what you must to survive
An endless role of life.
See, I care, now we are finally friends at last
And we have grown a truthful fruit.
It is safe to come out and see the world
Open your heart to spread
A joyful warmth and love.
[have talked long enough to you
Please speak and spread your words of wisdom.

"How content I am, at peace and rest
At ease from the breaking stress.

A warmth I can feel is all around
No rain anymore, to spoil the fun
And a mist so refreshing still hangs
Tam Fox, and I know the truth
Are you a fox too? You resemble one."

I am, but only part of me still is.
{ lost that part long ago.
But still my aim is to help you.
And you have made it through the stormy night.

Then the sun slowly rose over a mountain
And the warmth filled our tired hearts.
The dew-rich earth was a perfect bed
And I slept in the light of the sun
And my last glimpse from my friend
Was a flash of warmth from his eyes
We had both made it through the stormy night.

This psalm is meant to be poetic. It shows friendship and the act of
being all things to all men. It represents God and each other helping us
to get through times of trouble, both in our hearts, and outside our
hearts. A fox in this poem represents these traits that are good in a man.
Indeed, God wishes things such as these for every man, and it is He who

makes these things work out so well.

Lord who never relinquishes
His tasks are many indeed
Yet His wisdom is beyond all
Not a chore or second thought to Him
Prayers of us to do Him right
To worship, but not in vain
Every word uttered is heard
Every thought dreamt He knows
Every song has meaning to Him
Every passion in a Godly sense
Is grand before His eyes
His heart cares much for them
He knows how to satisfy
Our lust will come to an end
Only on He will our focus be
To bring about a constant change
And deliver His promises abrupt
To shape and mold ourselves
And trust in His devise
A plan laid out well for all
To come to His command
In earnest we seek His grace
And giving it much to all He does
We wondered when it comes
And wondered how to gain
Such a fact is exalted and free
For all this Liberty is spread
Not a token of our affair
Not because of what we did
But from a promise of God
He did what He set out to do
And became the lowest man
Once this was done at will
He became the greatest man.

The rains fall swiftly down
In time they mark the rhythm
In standing we watch the sky

Deliver us the Great Redeemer
From trials of long since past
Some days were made for praying
We speak through sincere hearts

Matthew, Mark, and J ohn
And Luke in their great minds
Continuing faith is carried on

To transcend the unfamiliar life

Cry from broken hearts
We've come to love the lost
Speak with relateable words

Have no small part in lies

From death the noble heart
He hears our very words
Becoming of the everlasting
Words thus spoke long ago

Let out our just emotions
Reveal our trying cause

Though brief, a strong impact
Designed not to judge, but teach
For God has done the best.

Jesus, a man in human form
Who came upon the Earth
Freedom known by His side
Peace pronounced by Him
A ragged man of wiry hair
Vanity was not in his mind
Grace and forgiveness were strong in his heart
Love was the greatest of all
Special ways in Him we trust
We could have been without
And not have known the difference
Shamefulness for what we’ ve done
We were all bad at once
Death on a cross from us
Laughter and mockery to him
Yet now we begin again
Through time our hearts have changed
Don’t waste time with idle days
With power God uses us each
Through a many decisive task
And though we seem a rare breed
We work like many men
Crowds have grown lazy around
Deceit and sin are an ocean
But by night we can remember
A star the same as before
Looking at the same sky as He
Upon the Earth He made
Broken are hearts of many
His love will mend them all.

There are times when we start anew
Our lives will change for good
Our purpose yet remains the same
And old thoughts remind us of the past
We clean up the mess that there is
Cleanliness will show us our state
But God is first in our minds
He gives us a chance to change
In repentance we move ahead
Our new place better than before
More wisdom buys at a lower price
Yet more effort needed to clean
We seek the future in faith
To step in unknowing situations
And be courageous nonetheless
For fate is known only by God
Let us pray he brings us grace
Let us work harder than before
Our lives have been rearranged
Broken down, built into a temple
Held together by his Word
United we form a complex
Many buildings on One foundation
Strong enough to hold many
All are supported by grace
We grow stronger by the day
Each week, month, and year are unique
Ever vastly growing in size and power
We must take into account
We all have a similar fate.

God, our creator with ideas in mind
Yet his creations treat him like dirt, which he created
Treated as an outcast, despised among men
A dark time it is indeed
No true love, just a time of favors

Look very hard at a certain thing
Observe its detailed features
This is how God sees everything

: Like this and even more

He sees to the very root of our subconscious
To be blameless until it comes out
Our innermost thoughts are known by him
Our dreams taken into account

Times will change at his command
Yet many will still reject his Word
The many disciples will cheer
For the lost did not think at all

May we encourage that which lives
Inside our hearts with hopes and dreams
In our minds seems a fairy tale
But more real than even we are
In a moment we curse the day
Hard times seem to control us
At night we grow lazy in mind
But by day he never leaves our minds
As one, in one mind, the mind of Christ
With a firm hand he supports us
We don’t fall with his protection.

God has shown us love
He has brought the great redeemer
He has made the kingdom grow strong
He has taught us to preach the Word
He has united the church
He has made us laugh
He has heard us cry
He looked down upon our souls
Here upon this cruel world
Leaving a lasting impression
Beyond the perception of most
We pray for the many at hand
Who do not want to know
So how can they understand?
Train your mind for righteousness
And pour the heart on them
Preaching him to the many
How many are yet to hear?
We will know at the final Day
When you decide on idle time
Just kill time in a spiritual way
Look at yourself for awhile
Have you died your last dead sin?
Jesus did everyday, no sin at all
You must not contradict yourself
And not contradict the Word
To show your heart in true color
Bathe yourself in godly hope
Miracles through faith every day
For saving souls is a prime example.

How can Heaven seem to us?
Beauty not set in our minds
Our bodies could by no means survive
The brilliance would blind our eyes
The touch would be out of control
Music too beautiful to hear
Too much knowledge to handle
And God, Ob! Too much to comprehend
Tears of joy in eternal skies
More sweet than the sweetest song
Brighter by far than the sun
This is why I am glad to die
Before I enter Heaven’s realm
My body couldn’t handle the pleasure
Nothing on Earth can remotely compare
The ultimate best time here on Earth
Is far from the lowest point in Heaven
Off the scale by much
{do not dare to even try to compare
Such extremes they are very far
As Heaven is to Earth, Earth is to Hell
So be proud, everyone of your salvation
And give all thanks to the Almighty God
Who never looked back at our past
Who doesn’t hold a grudge
Who easily do as he pleases
But we must still take concern
And give everyone the precious chance
For God deserves at very least that
And pray God will increase our faith.

Yet our tasks reveal His glory
Sent for an important task
Everyone should see the same
Tired eyes watch quietly
Of Him we must give account
A spiritual focus is established
We set our minds on this
To live as the Great Redeemer
The inspiring Author of Life
To be fired up everyone
For a second, third, and many more tries
We patiently work with honest hearts
We speak the truth of God
His honor and glory unmatched
For from Him came the Righteous One
Let us not go for numbers
Or get prideful when you do more than them
But you must set the example
Touch a star and see God’s glory
When we rise up above the world
To lift up the lost to know
And love will be spread around
And eternal peace will be found
Let us never go astray
Lead us on the righteous path.

We get a taste of persecution today
We should pride ourselves and shout amen!
The world sees time as its own
They say we should follow their rules on their time
But men who follow rules of the world
Will get confused on what at all to do
But God’s Law is set in stone
Follow it and never go wrong
For it does not contradict itself
As many worldly points of view do
They may try to take our lives
But we will not give up
They may try to take our possessions
But we shall never quit
For the world is never satisfied
It longs for ever more
But God has brought His promise
A vow that shall never end
Written in a Book unchanging
Since God can never tell a lie
He will nourish our needy souls
With Jesus, pure love, in so many ways
Increase our faith each day
You have for many years
From the first day to today
You have seen this very moment
Let our praises count the ways
Such love He has shown to us
Who needs proof when you have this
Let those who want proof know
That God is brought by faith
Eternal glory to the King!

Silent procession through the night
The saints tell of their belief
Hearers await the next presentation
Clouds cover God’s holy face
As He works in the hearts of the saints

And so they led the hearers
Watchful eyes expect their lead
Emotions brought forth in time

How should we take their direction
By God’s Word which works so powerfully

Listen to their final instruction
Take to heart their wisdom spent
If you question what you don’t see
Perhaps the night is why this is so
Search the word in your heart for faith

Patience marks a virtue, their dream
And listen quietly for them in the night

How can we go on
Only through our faith
In Jesus name we say our prayers
The mighty heart comes to us
A spirit of discerning and trust
In faith we present our work
With no pride, such a humble heart
Grace and gratitude are shared
Knowledge is exchanged for wisdom
As we grow old, we should not die
For our bodies were dead long ago
We should instead entrust in Him
Who died to help us grow
A single God can indeed relate
As a father does to his son
Love beyond what we do expect
And way beyond the worldly love
No true love can be without Him
He can see our heart’s desire
The kingdom being first in line
We should humble ourselves to the end
The line sets our priorities
From God, so far upstairs
Down to brothers, sisters, and lost
Even our own families may not know
So we must show them why
Prayers on top of our agenda
For we have so much to learn.

We are treasured possessions
For God holds on to us
We speak on His behalf
As ambassadors to the king
We base our life on righteousness
And prosper in solely that
Our bold values show unmistakably
And quiet senses break the silence
Victory is at God’s command
His purity rightly shows
Mild and firm a humble King
Lord sent shepherd for us
We were lost in ourselves
We put nothing before us
But now His time has come
His glory will be ultimately shown
Peace be redefined by Him
As well as glory, love, and truth
Sing, how much we shall do
Living by truth in His sight
We calmly expect Him to come
When He does, that glorious Day
We will sing our praises stored up
And behold, the eternal redeemer
Whose love shown in the drops of blood
Prepare yourself to live forever
Beside God’s eternal glorious Name.

Faith means not being surprised
When what you hope for happens
Faith itself destroys all doubts
Which kill your confidence
Faith gives us authority
To do what our strength cannot
Faith will increase our wisdom
From God who graciously gives
Faith we put in our every work
For success will be undoubtedly shown
Faith can lead to bold acts
Courage to live on the edge
Faith will give us trust in each other
As well as the living God
Faith gives us contact with the King
To speak for once and finally be heard
Faith a strong expectation
The epitome of confidence
Faith can conquer the evil in us
By bringing out sins deep within
Faith can expose our souls
More powerful deeds at this state
Faith is the key to success
With a much better chance than nil
Faith can cure the pain in our hears
Gods softening touch brings relief
Faith can change the course of events
For Jesus had faith in us when he died.

How hard it may seem, the subjects 0
In which we always participate
The rules and regulations there are
Society’s standard for all men
But apart we are from the world
To bring so many to God from afar
Changing the world a man at a time
But many still cannot understand
For God has hidden it from their eyes
This gift of reasoning He has placed upon us
And discerning minds in His presence
Two different tales can arise from that
The truths of the lost and the saved
We should look at the sky, which God has made
From there to the ground is His own
Though peaceful at times when we care
God can get rough at other times
Though concerned, he brings us blessings
Every beat of your heart is one such of these
The delicate paths that are placed in your mind
Are all too common to Him
The complex DNA of any man
Are but a word to Him
And how heavy a mountain to us
A feather when God is concerned
So center your minds on such wonder
An awesome God leads us on
Touched by His holy hands inside
We must give respect and honor to Him
He deserves nothing less than that.

We get tired in thought and mind
We tend not to concern ourselves
We make promises that we should keep
But at times things come up again
We should make a new commitment
Change from our old lacking ways
Strive to do more things for Him
To perfect ourselves through trials
Many mistakes we will do
Many problems we will face
But be confident in this as such
Jesus himself went through more
The hour is approaching for us
We must be prepared for that
We do not know when it will be
But when it comes we will know
God has made this promise
We should bow at His great truth
And give ourselves up to Him
Try not to comprehend
His glory and honor He has
But instead entrust yourself in Him
For He will always hold you up

Yet many still remain tired
They don’t focus on these things
They tend to drowse into confusion
Not knowing what they have done
God doesn’t want this to be
He knows what is best for us
To focus on Him most importantly
And trust ourselves in this
For He will never choose to leave
Forever He will be and has been
In an infinite God we can trust.

How many leaders there really are
Depends on the hearts of disciples
Our accomplishments will be shown
For the effort we are willing to give
We shouldn’t grow lazy in mind
Let it not be based on our mood
Times change and so do feelings
So convictions are a vast necessity
Surely will come that inevitable day
When we will not be on Earth
Prepare everyone for that time
And share your faith impressively
We who are older disciples
Must set examples for others to follow
Because Jesus set an example for us
We must follow in His steps
Be fired up at this instant
And every instant you are alive
For this will bring along faith
And with faith anything can be done
Faith toward God is glory to Him
And glory is what we should give
Not out of sheer obligation
But out of love which he graciously gives
This system He created so well
Is made known to all who care
And He blinds the eyes of who don’t
So they don’t know who He is
Many miracles are yet to be shown
Many others yet to be known
Let’s perform with His expectation
To follow the Words great rules
Not to be all legalistic in this
But showing love to help one another
And us growing closer to God.

When we are almost done
Lets make it extra special
Putting our hearts into it
And a giving of ourselves
To complete a lengthy task
Always to glorify Him
Three-quarters done and measured well
We know when our goal is done
But this is the start of one task
Many more are sure to come
We have hope that we will succeed
With God on our side we will
No worries at all with Him
We can trust it will be done
Before we weren’t too sure of ourselves
But now with Him its a fact

Can we answer the questions of life?
Can we know the knowledge?
Can we understand the deepest root?
Without God this is impossible
With Him the hardest question is not
The solution comes very fast
There is no question too hard for Him
Or any chore too difficult to complete

But thanks be to God for our life
Thanks for His great concern
His love for us will never perish
Sing tears of joy to Him
Blessed be Jesus for what He did
Too much to explain at once
More than the books of the world
Are His good deeds and miracles
For He has saved a dying world.

We glorify God in the highest
With force we advance the Word
A trusting encampment of faith
Rides like the wind on a curb
Bring praise to Him the King
Such as the last day on Earth
Quickly doing our godly tasks
To bring unlimited glory to Him
Cry for not doing enough
For we cannot compare to Him
Instead we do our potential
And all praises to the King
Mystical splendor is His love
His eternal eyes never wonder
He never struggles the least
And we should encourage that
To everyone who takes after Him
And sets their lives in His view
No boundaries set for what we must do
For no works could be grand enough
We should work till our bodies are weak
And pray to God for more strength
He will understand in us
And pour upon us unlimited grace
And lets encourage each other
And march the kingdom with godly force
And have a godly commitment
To never swerve from the Bible’s words
Truth no more than God there is
For He gave the meaning to this
Patience He has for us all
For we make mistakes by the handful
Sometimes men may seem correct
Deceit may be used to confuse
Or maybe the don’t know they’re wrong
Because no one is sure but God

Don’t be silent on these days
We need to share His Word
Treat every day like your last
To give every talent to God
Because nobody knows for sure
When this day will come
For we need to be prepared
And fight every day to be ready
Do not go hide on this day
Do not try to escape the view
Because anywhere we go
To try and escape
Will only be lost in confusion
Again it is time to rejoice
For we need not worry any more
We who are not lost can do so
And teach others the same
Our hearts will help us on
When encouraged by His words
Commit them to memory at once
So your heart shall never forget
For everyone needs a reminder
Of what He did for us
To not just take it for granted
Such a gift more deserving than that
And so whatever you do
And whatever you think
Just give to God what is due
And many blessings he will pour upon you.

There is a time when we ate born
When we come out new in the world
It takes time to learn what to do
And how to do these many things

There are so many things to do
In such a short amount of time
We can do everything there is
And not repeat anything at all

Through many trials we must go
We will succeed with Him beside
He fights on our side each day
Because the battles aren’t won alone

We will highly value His name
We will concern ourselves with Him
We meditate to think it through
We never wonder of our choice

The past let go, He doesn’t remember
He cares not for our wicked past deeds
But now is the time for changes
To change everyday for more good

How many tasks can we do?
How much can we possibly handle?
We never give up at any cost
Instead we grow closer to God

Troubles will come like floods
But blessings evermore so
For God blesses those in trouble
Who acknowledge His Word and obey.

March through the world in honor
For being chosen by God
But don’t take pride in yourself
For we are not worthy for Christ
Peace is promised to us
Forever we will have rest
And we can do much on Earth
With faith we can do anything
No limit is known by us
Hearts can be changed by the thousands
And millions brought at once to Christ
We must remember His love
To die for the noblest cause
No one has love as close as His
No one has ever compared
He will rise up the Kingdom
And guide us through our days
But we will not stop at now
We will not procrastinate
We will in fact be diligent
And work for Jesus’ sake
Such commitment was given to us
And we must do the same
To God lets give everything
And we won’t stumble and fall
Trials, yes we will have some
And many will attack us in that
But we shall never be defeated
No cause is too strong for God
Listen with your heart to His words
And place them into your mind
Never forget for once their meaning
And God will never forget you.

How far is our journey to go
How long can we please God
Sincere hearts ask questions as these
And what we do matters so
Surrounded by uncaring worlds
Pursued by unrelenting men
But we do not turn away
We love all people the same
For God never shows bias
He never says we are better
He loved us when we were lost
And being found, we can do more
His holy spirit can guide us on
To never mess up so bad
That we cannot get up again
There will be pain in these times
But God never gives us too much
He takes all the blows and hurting
To make sure we stay alive
We will never die with him
A spark growing into a bonfire
We explode in the world at once
So everyone notices our acts
But still many will not care
They will hurl insults at us
But persevere in your task
And give all the glory to God
Everyday we will do these things
To praise our Holy Creator
And sanctify His eternal Name.

Doalm 75-80

While we see most beautiful things
Remember, it is not eternal
And when you smell a flower
Or take a breath of mountain air
In fact, nothing in all creation
Can even remotely compare
God in His form is love
Sweeter than sugar by far
More pure than sweet water
More holy than a thousand prophets
The only good in all creation
Because nothing can be created as good
He sets the rules so obey them
Out of love, not sheer obligation
Persevere, how much must I say
Though tired, try just once more
God will bless you with strength
Endurance will keep you going on
And trust will be shown all around
Sing the sweet song of praise
Glorify God and ask how
There are too many ways to count
So worship the God above
The creator of all the land
The Universe held in His hand
But he notices you, meek and small
This pertains not only to you
But to me, and all other men
Though lost some may be
They will surely find God
This is if He wants them to
So check your heart one last time
Do not frown at your tiring task
Believe me, I feel tired sometimes
But God pushes me on
And it is love that works so powerfully.

Some days we tend to wonder
What is there to do?
We think on a superficial level
Not going deep for simplicity's sake
We fail to scratch the surface
Of what lies in our minds
Perhaps out of laziness
In body, spirit, and mind
But let us not give in
To weakness we may present
But pray to God for strength
Dedication, devotion, and love
To move on with evermore force
Such as God will be made known
Many will wonder on how
To do such massive tasks
With intricate details in mind
But worry not as of how
For God will teach you this
You shall be in suspense no longer
No one will worry any more
His word shows all the answers
To any question you can present
Let us be purified from within
To express and outward truth
And give eternal praise to the King
In righteousness and fellowship
Let us make them both worthwhile
Never pondering on if we were right
If what we did mattered at all
For each action presented by us
Is to God first and most of all
It is time we show our worth
As we give all the glory to Him
By working hard, as He allows
For He could have made it different




--- Page 95 ---
Patience is possessed by us
And virtue is shown in our eyes
For God's holy spirit is living
In each and every one of us
Let us not forsake these gifts
And not take them for granted
Not to squander our power
Or live according to ourselves
For selfishness never had a place
In a Kingdom established by Him
Neither did doubt or misfortune
So be gone with envy and anger
Let alone your lustful ways
Hang up your coat of laziness
And place upon God's armor of truth
And work diligently for His sake
To show your remembrance of Him
For his love will never be forgotten
And we will celebrate
When God comes in His glory
Disciples will glorify Him.

How much can we hate our sin
These things rip us apart
Tear us down, separate us
And kill us spiritually
No place in our heart
Was set for dishonest deeds
Temptations will provoke us
Into hurting God again
Deliver us from evil, Mighty One
Catch us from our fall
The devil has toyed with our emotions
And satisfied his grueling desires
But we will stand up in unison
We will take guard against him
Never will we fall beyond correction
For repentance is a powerful key
Doubt erased from our minds
No doubt that God can help
And fix us from our broken ways
As disciples we know the way
And time will pass quite fast
We will remember our past
How God lifted us out of darkness
While leaving the careless to die
Remove from our minds evil thoughts
Let us rid ourselves of temptations
How hard it would be by ourselves
But each other and God will guide
Only one will prevail in this battle
The war surely won by God
Our bodies were weak at one time
But now, strengthened by God's love
Now put to death all your evil
And walk beside in God's light.

How much the beauty of a flower
Not such the beauty of God
Relish the warmth of the sun
God’s warm heart conquers even that
A mountain stands mighty on Earth
God’s great power stands on even more
Honor the patience of leaders
God’s patience can last more than men
Mountain climbers indeed are brave
God’s boldness against many men
Bomb experts who put out the dangers
God can put out the sun
A shaman’s wisdom is very acute
God’s knowledge exceeds every nation
Indeed we are sad when someone dies
God is sad when the sinful lives
We laugh at many a joke
God’s humor would kill us from laughing
We smile when we are happy
God smiles when we turn from wrong
We tend to love someone most
God loves all the same
We read the book to learn
God wrote the book and knows
We change everyday for good
God has no need for change
We strive to be perfect in Christ
God, the epitome of good
Songs we sing to glorify Him
God sings songs to us
Faith we are constantly learning
Faith so much, God can freely give
We strive for a humble heart
God can humble Himself no more.

Peaceful ties to bind us
Relationships in which we trust
Skills not nonconforming
Talents used for which he gave us
And faith with endless bounds
Love shared with one another
And sacred tithes set aside
For use for God’s purpose
In which He commands us with
Anger for once set aside
Jealousy and envy put away
Following the one true God
He beholds the eternal Kingdom
We praise His name forever
Wherever at all we pray
Sing to Him the virtueous song
That we have overcome
We shall take hold of these blessings
For our names are carved in stone
We train our minds to learn each day
His words never cease to amaze
Or inform us of our duties
Not obligation but a loving desire
To complete the work laid out
Started at Jesus glorification
We must inform all peoples
Shout for all to hear
Tell the tale of truth
In servitude Jesus lived
To be honored at the great feast
We denounce our paltry sin
And live blameless in His eyes.

Oh Lord, do mend our relationship
Build it strong with durable goods
Prime it with your honest nature
And shape it with your love
We build a stronger nation
On a foundation of eternal strength
Never to be shaken or broken
In truth for Jesus said
Wash us in all wisdom
Bathe us in your light
Clean us of our sins
And dress us with your trust
Look at us as children
Teach us as we mature
Never to question our salvation
Pure as light, white as snow
Because of Jesus sake
Promiscuous sometimes in thoughts
But God will teach us the path
One true way, such through Him
To believe in a higher way
Live a life of denial
Not to urge yourself to temptation
But deliver yourself from that
Attention to our leaders
An ear to learn the Word
Speak not before you listen
Your questions will surely be answered
In the time God has prepared
For everything has a purpose
And God knows when it is
So once more give celebration
No tribulation has stayed on us.

When we run out of ideas
When our minds draw a blank
We tend to lose connection
And our thoughts go all astray
God can help these things
Get you back on the track
To win the race of integrity
And exceed your very goals
Expedite our talents
Use them for the common good
Appreciate our godly desires
In which we can please God
We turn an ear to God
To hear much wisdom shared
We listen to his advancements
To teach everybody the news
We prepare to learn all wisdom
No limits as such our minds
We can hold all the information
And feed it to our hungry hearts
The holes have been filled with God
Our soul has been satisfied
Once we lacked what we didn’t know
And now our knowledge mends us
And the inevitable day will come
And we will be together
Every one of the disciples
Will share a story immense
And who we baptized and them
Will shout amen in unison
For wicked we are no more
And lost we were long ago
So again rejoice once more
For the time that God has shared
Believe wholeheartedly in Him
Who gives us such a great cause.

We shall give him honor
We shall lavish him gifts
We shall bless His Name
We shall address Him as Father
We shall confess to Him
We shall pray to Him

We will be righteous to Him
We will be blameless in His eyes
We will remember His heart
We will not fall distraught
We will surrender our lives
We will live for Him
We will not hide away from Him
We will work diligently for Him

In these things God will listen
He will hear our desperate cries
He will yoke us as His own
And we will live as sons
Of the Almighty God
To Him all honor and praise
Such of the entire world can give
And He be forever known.

Praise God for our senses
We who use them well
They let us know our feelings
Emotions checked from these
To feel the warm sunshine
To hear the sweetest song
To gaze upon our destiny
The beauty of Heaven in a soul
Many say we’re intoxicated
When we find value in what they don’t
We taste the pure water
It nourishes us to our soul
When traits are brought about
The majestic throne sits tranquil
God’s glory never be disturbed
Even disciples don’t do God justice
Yet we are closer than most
Safe on the sturdy narrow path
Unchanging in our very beliefs
We learn every day of new prophecy
New words of wisdom to us
These words wrote long ago
Do still apply to everyone
Fear God in a humble way
Obey the commands of Him
All sentient peoples are held accountable
Our actions tell of our heart
Our wild side may tempt us
And try to pull us away
We must stop and consider
Our priorities we have set
These are our basic intuitions
Struggle not when they are firm
For we have the deepest convictions
As disciples we surely must.

Faith brings about discernment
We see into their hearts
We understand where they’ re from
These men who wonder why
We cherish the sacred words
Enabling us to comply
: We whisper things to each other
Sometimes hoping for none to hear
God shows His noble character
He pertains to long lost men
Not only them but disciples
All together we are in this
One such plan laid out bare
Blueprints shown to all
We know our futures and theirs
But many don’t believe or refuse
When we win a race for God
We cheer from accomplishment
For great was the task He asked
But power to complete was given
The whole picture an integral part
One in the same is itself
Sure as the Son of God is God
We bow to Him and through Him pray
We make our wishes known
With believing so strong this faith
Our trust is given freely
To one another, brother and sister alike
Many just dream however
They just don’t believe in these
They grip their quasi-beliefs
To know no saving truth
Let us now consider
That forever God endures
And he will embrace our commitment
And show us many wonders along.

The kingdom is ever advancing
Disciples take it in their hands
We acknowledge our tasks ahead
In time they will be complete
Our basic intuition tells us
Of what does wait in store
For many of the disciples
Will inherit treasures untold
We face each day with concern
As well as we should do
We should look to the details
Of what and how to do
We triumph quite frequently
Our splendors surely show
God’s honor will come to rest
On many who work in His name
We seek the earnest words
The commands are right up front
Not bland in the eyes of anyone
And no one can hide from them
We praise the eternal God
Who breathes His life in us
His spirit is shown in disciples
Each and every one knows
Though we rejoice everyday
From some small happening
Let us really celebrate
When God’s glory is really shown
Whoever it is doesn’t matter
It is all the same
Their hearts will tell and dedicate
All they are to Him who lives
God bless our integrity
And strengthen our honesty
Our prize is in those souls
Who haven’t known you yet

Each day has a new happening
With pride we advance it well
And we don’t just expect
We do and do with faith
Rise up the leaders will
And followers will follow their lead
Such examples will be set
Too many to count indeed
And once there will be no waste
Everything has its basic purpose
No one can boast this time
For all the glory to God
We walk now the path of righteousness
And sow the seed of salvation
For God helps them grow from temptation
And sin will dissolve in their hearts
No more will we struggle beyond help
No more will we be crippled
No more will we pity ourselves
But we will stand up for what’s right
And of course there is only one right
In God’s sight we should follow this
For let us follow what is perfect
The word and all its expectations
Will save or condemn all men
And we have justified these
We justify it only one way
Only through God’s interpretation
So no one can say they’re more right
So calm your aching desires
Quench your endless wants
Just live off of what you need
And save the rest to go around
For once when this is done
When you have completed every task
You can look at yourself and say
“Ag a servant | have done my job.”

Herein we share our faith
Not out of obligation
But out of respect, love, and duty
We are but servants in a kingdom
With a king who cares for us
We work hard for Him
And the profits of the kingdom grow
From a tiny seed every soul starts
To grow to a mighty tree
Sprouting fresh fruit periodically
We spark the interest of the common man
They wonder what we’re about
What do we mean when we tell them
Our purpose that is a disciple
Our standard which we strictly obey
Not to confuse it with the world
For our beliefs and doctrine are strong
So strong the unquenchable fire
We burn hot in the eyes of men
We are the smell of death to them
They run from all our truths
But God is the one they should fear
For He can condemn their very soul
And think for once of this wonder
How powerful He is indeed
Our pride is in His hands
He commands us on what to do
And we listen as humble servants should
We don’t complain or question His authority
But sometimes we tend to wonder
About our place in life
Don’t concern yourself for your status
For God never wanted dispute
We shouldn’t compete with one another
For no one is closer to God




--- Page 107 ---
No matter what we can do
No matter what we can say
As the teacher says it means nothing
Worldly views will pass in time
Anguish will cease to exist
And we will cheer forever
And celebrate on the good news
For we were given an undeserving chance
To try and make it right
But we are not perfect in His eyes
We don’t even come close
But blessed be God for His love
Give Him so much honor from heart
Wisdom in the eyes of men
May seem of prime importance
But God sees different than men
He looks to our very hearts
He concerns Himself with details
While also seeing the bigger picture
And we need to pattern this life
We need to focus on more
The more we do the more we know
And vice-versa is much the same
For we do not sit back
And let the world pass us by
We are ahead of the world
In God’s sight and with each other
So consider once more your plan
Make it God’s plan definitely
Do not complain or whine
For God never gave up on you
And when you look back to the past
When all your chores are done
You will most definitely say
“Peace be with me at last!”
And God will hear this prayer
And He will take notice of you again
For you never left His mind
He never left your imagination or mind.

Doalm 71S -92

We pass the time in fashion
Every second is accounted for
Every deed we do is known
: And all our tasks have meaning
We don't do anything in vain
We give our lowly oblation
For our gifts don't amount to God's
He has given freely many times
He has sacrificed more than all
If you add all men's gifts to God
They don't add up to His
How much can we glorify His name
How much can we give Him honor
What in all the world can we do
But be ourselves and follow His word
He will not hold a biased grudge
He will not look at you differently
He will not show favoritism
But He will treat all saved the same
And so we should show our thanks
We should give Him of ourselves
To try hard day and night
To bring blessings upon many to Him
And He will always remember
Our baptism into His kingdom
He rules with an iron fist
But is also gentle as silk
He fits every situation
To perfection with no mistakes
For He knows what's best for everyone
So don't complain of your destiny
We were chosen by God
To deliver the message to all
To give everyone the same chance
That God graciously gave us
As the desert is dry
So too would we be





--- Page 109 ---
Without God all would be dead
Desolation would be only known
And no pleasures would be here
In fact neither would we
No fun would be known without God
No knowledge would be shared
No songs to share the glory
From all the men who give
The stars show much of your splendor
The creator of all there is
Out of nothing the Universe was made
By God who knows all there is
The blueprints in His mind long before
He knew always what would come about
He knew right to you right now
Even at the beginning of time
For nothing is beyond God's comprehension
Nothing can confuse His mind
So don't weasel out of a situation
Where God can use you well
No matter the dangers involved
As servants we must obey
We should not get confused
For focus plays a big part
And in context it should
For faith need focus to work
Because you need to know what you wish for
And your hope needs a strong end result
And we thirst for the living God
His name ever bums in our heart
We are fired up from Him
He gives these emotions to us
And not just based on mood
But conviction to do what is right
And we know what is right for sure
For the Word says what we need to hear
And many will not want these words
And not want to follow their lead
But stop for once and consider
What God has in store for you.




--- Page 110 ---
Doalm 7S-93

Praise God for our intuition
Our ability to discern the obvious
To know what is right to Him
And not to choose the wrong
To be blameless in His eyes
To see into His spirit
He resides within us all
To encourage us from within
We speak from our very hearts
Words of wisdom, faith, and truth
We sing from our hearts as well
Songs of praise and virtue
We need to understand the rest
His plan which lies so clear
Is void of complications
So for starters we understand
We do not need a college degree
To interpret the Word of God
We do not need to prove it
To make other disciples of Christ
But those things can really help
For us to reach out to them
For you must be one to relate
And to understand them
So concentrate on what is near
And partake in His wealth
His riches outnumber the world’s
No one on earth comes close
And we’d much rather have those
Than any amount on earth
For worldly wealth does fade
But Heaven lasts forever
So do not give up on them
The lost need our help
To share our inspiration
And not charge admission for that
For the gift isn’t ours to give




--- Page 111 ---
So how could we want compensation
For doing the work asked us
In the first place not worthy to do
And so see the stars in the sky
As numerous as all the lost souls
They wonder aimlessly like the souls
Stars and souls can resemble each other
We are the fire in the stars
We burn with the brilliance of Christ
For God lives in our hearts
He resides inside our bodies
With our soul, next door
We can work with both
Inspiring one another
With talents like gold but more rich
Our prize is our very salvation
We seize it for what it is
The opportunity has not passed us by
We have chosen to follow the plan
And comprehend what to do
Think it over before we consider
To take the step toward Heaven
Our distinction between those realms
Heaven not like the earth
They don’t even compare
So let’s just focus on now
And let Heaven come by surprise
For the best gift it will be
What a noble present God gives
To save our souls from Satan
Our lives not ours to live
And so remember for once
Again it will hit you too
You will come to know Him
And never forget in your life
So meditate on these words
On the words that Christ has given
All the teachings he taught
All the impacting lessons
Are all for one simple purpose
The purpose of making disciples.

What of God can I write
How deep should I search my heart
How right would I be in saying
Can I explain in words His love
How much charisma does He have
Can He charm but every man
How many words has He whispered
To us for our souls to hear
How many inspirational things
Can God devote to us
He shows much more than we can count
Beyond the concepts of math
Numbers cannot explain God
So advanced, not even the best math
When we hold God in awe
We may forget the simple things
We concern ourselves with education
Why, but to earn an honest living
Yet God has shown us a valuable time
To reach out to the out of reach of many
Not everyone gets this chance
We must show our appreciation
And not take it for granted what we have
Our minds go abstract sometimes
When we think in all dimensions
And savor the flavor of different views
Variety is shown by God indeed
The diversity of the church is known
Everyone will see God in time
When God decides to reveal Himself
His word divides our secular words
When our hearts show lack of love
When we see only one small point
No broad view it seems to us
God will make you remember




--- Page 113 ---
Your baptism was your decision
God appointed you as a witness
And an ambassador to the King
Glory! We are all saved
Blessed be God for not being too busy
For nothing is too much for God
Can but the Universe obey His command
Let us fear the living God
But His spirit give us boldness elsewhere
At night we sleep in peace
Anticipating what will happen next
Looking forward to another day
With God, to share the good news
So again how much can Ido
How much as a collective body
All with a similar goal in mind
To bring all to the same conclusion
A whisper, a promise was said
In desperation we seek the truth
And no more real such truth exists
Than God, the Word, and Heaven’s realms
But that is not all there is
A single psalm cannot completely tell
The very words and meanings entwined
Within the fabric of belief
Rejuvenate your primary mind
God has hidden a secret within
And we should aspire to learn
To get to know what He gives
For the more we begin to understand
The more thankful we can become
And so bring evermore glory to God
Of which He well deserves
So now do not struggle with Him
For you surrendered long ago
The war is over, we’ve won
With God on our side it was sure
For the eternal battle rages on
Many souls will cry out for help.




--- Page 114 ---
Poalm 75-95

How many times do we say each day
“I want to invite you to church”
Each time marks a new requisite

For the souls that ask for help
They might not know consciously
But indeed they all need God
In some form or another
They want to understand
We scatter seed everywhere
And all the days of our lives
And ask that God will help it grow
And water it with His spirit
Each moment gone we wonder
How many souls we can save
How much labor is involved
It doesn’t matter at all
Just do our duty He asked
And reap our rewards in the future
We shall never exhaust our strength
Our work for the good cause
Here is a picture much more than they see
It is too large to comprehend
So we take a little each day
And through our life come to understand
The true workings of an ideal christian
Who never spurned correction
His heart was turned right out
So many could see and help out
We train our minds every day
To take in the increasing knowledge
For wisdom will grow ever more
By force we will accept it
You cannot keep from learning
Everything you see and do
And what you hear stays fixed




--- Page 115 ---
Within your primary mind
So let us recognize the luxury
Of having a rare example
Not too many real christians
Are doing this all around
So shake the earth for once
As we lead a peaceful revolution
We aim to take Christs words
And give them to the common man
All the other basic religions
Will be shown by their true worth
They will be exposed and contradicted
For many will put their faith in Christ
His words have no contradictions
No lies, no deceit can be found
Anywhere in the pages
Just look, none will be found
And so we lowly creations
From dirt we came about
We must understand the power involved
To do such an awesome task
God raises His powerful arm
To show us such wonders
The bible written without physical contact
God used the prophets as pens
Indeed He was quite intelligent
To relate to us in these ways
Christ not a superman
He died such as a man would
If put in a situation the same
So look again at the kingdom
See its powerful advance
It will never die in frustration
For we will never disagree about the Word
We will not argue these things
We will not see who is better
For all are the same under the Lord
That no one can boast or pity
And the Lord shall see us raise up.

When rains come down we remember
Tt is not always the same
Sometimes mixed with sunshine
It can have multiple traits
You can see all the details
One by one at a similar time
We must always be ready
For any situation to come about
We chase dreams much like the wind
Tn which the context cannot explain
Words are like the droplets
The light shows their true color
Split in definite proportions
All possibilities are clearly defined
We see the rainbow of truth
Its beauty presented to all
Clouds give it in moderation
Not to be bombarded by everything
It is special when this happens
We look back to a beautiful place
Concerning ourselves not with now
And imagine the beautiful outcome
Our cause will make it come about
For the world can grow dark each day
Like raindrops we cover the ground
Not missing any spot at all
We wet people with our words
So that our presence is known
Everyone will see us sometime
And they will have many questions
Of who, what, when, where, why
We will speak the words of the prophets
The crystal droplets will give us way
So no good word will be left unuttered
And so no cause for alarm
Because all will hear the message




--- Page 117 ---
Nobody will be left unaccounted
They will spring from their own choosing
To fall down upon the many crowds
Who will soak up their words like ours
So do not fear the rain
The thunder sounds our arrival
We will not give up anytime
Just as the rain keeps going
And when all have heard
We will save the more for later
So that not to get too much
For they will see our purpose
We will make sure of that
So they too will have the same intent
And we will praise the Lord for that
How many times must we struggle
To deliver these valuable gems
Not so massive at once
But small enough to consider
And to acknowledge their existence
More real than we ever were
For these words created us in a way
And brought us from eternal destruction
So pass your time spiritually
Remember God for what He did
For who He is as a savior
And a servant among the rest
We grow tired among the days
Our hearts grow weary and weak
But this nourishing droplets
Can cool our burning questions
That linger so evidently in our mind
The rains also help the seeds
That we plant with dedication
To help them grow up stronger
For water raises up life
The rains of the words of the bible
Can bring us all salvation
Just for once consider
God’s grace will never end.

Poala 7S-97

Oh, what a wicked soul am I
I feel not worthy of God
Sometimes I tend to get involved
With too much sin to handle
I think not of God when I do
And I speak what I think about
I never remembered Jesus
His death on the cross for me
And yet I keep sinning constantly
And even then the same sin
When I repent and mean it
I slip back to the old ways

But I need to not feel depression
I need not to pity myself
I will change for the better
For God wants me to see this way
I need to be optimistic
And not dread the future days
And not put myself through temptations
For I don’t have a reason at all
No chance to escape the facts
For each particular message I write
I mean with all my heart
And I will continue to change

God will give us courage
To confess to one another
Just let us take the initiative
And not just go with the flow
Be radical in our mindset
Not to just ponder our minds
But change the way things are
And make a new example
For Christ is a perfect example
We should shoot for His way of life




--- Page 119 ---
Spare us the misery
That was so common so long
We will strive for ever more
To do many things under Him
So never walk alone
But keep God inside you
His spirit remains unaltered
Much more of us than even we are
So go for that which knows
Who has been to where we’ ve been
Who knows how to stay from trouble
And not get involved in sin
So praise be to our godly ambition
That keeps us striving on
Not to stop at our struggles
But fighting for our relationship
Let us fast when it is needed
To increase our bond with God
To make the heart grown fonder
And to learn to accept Him
So please help me forever
I am useless alone
I can not take on the problems
Without God beside my soul
So let us speak with disciplers
To learn to trust each other
And not bombard with problems
But sort them through one at a time
And this will be more realistic
Much a more solvable task
When we no longer wonder
Then we will surely be there
Glory to the King for our talents
So we can let off some steam
Our chest weighs heavy with doubts
And sin hidden deep within
So let us pour out our hearts
One more time to show our trust
And God will hear our cries
And show us the right way out.

Poalm 7S-98

We shall hunger for God’s love
We need it now more than ever
To guide us in a straight path
And never let us down
We shall never be needy
Since God is all around
God wakes us up every day
To start the day for Him
To learn a new lesson
And never forget the old
We speak from our hearts
So everyone will know our words
We speak our dearest truths
And was given by the Book
The one and only truth
That will never die
In an entire library large
Only one will last forever
And it is always alive
Not such the other books
We should pride ourselves in it
And read everyday the Word
Times will get tough indeed
Challenges will come our way
But we must hold on to our beliefs
The sacred words will help
And keep us from falling down
To guide others away from the dangers
We shine out as examples
Our shining lights make others glow
Peaceful is our light
We come not to bring destruction
But new life through God instead
For He has given us this chance
And we should pay our respects
Our love of God will grow




--- Page 121 ---
Never to stop till the end
Always advancing powerfully
Such as our real friendships
What new thing can we speak about
Each day is new in itself
So speak of the actions of the day
And the events that came about
We want to give up when times get rough
Our tired hearts need some rest
But let us persevere and endure
Through even the irritating times
Struggles will come in waves
But we will be prepared
Our inspiring leaders do know
And help us to counter these obstacles
They teach us the ways to succeed
Because they have had the experiences
And we learn from one another
To cover every possibility
Never to leave any doubts
Of whether we will have an answer
For no problem is too large for God
Or too small to seek advice
We will get help when we ask
And the help will be relished by us
We share our rewards with others
And give them the overflow
Our hearts will not contain the mass
So much good to go around
So speak of this wonder around
Let all know of its presence
Let many people comprehend
Its enormous impact on us
God sees you now whatever you do
Let it be for His eternal glory
For what you do in His presence
Will tell of your true heart
No limitations will be found
In how to glorify God
He will not let there be.




--- Page 122 ---
Poalm 75-99

Praise the Lord, whom we will glorify
Our highest respects to His Name
The world can seem so large
When we have not trained our minds
The concept of God is larger
And God for real larger still
Our tongues give Him the praises
That reflect us in our nature
Believe in a greatest power
Such that time cannot confine
All limits done away with
And much the same for all disciples
God will give us such powers
Fear will vanish from our hearts
Replaced by a godly trust
Confidence installed through boldness
All seasons will present their patience
An entire three months to prepare
And we will prepare ourselves in style
We will learn it evermore
No torment will be in our hearts
Eternal rest will be on our minds
As we share to our heart’s content
Wars will come like a flood
To challenge many men
But we will win every battle
And God will ensure every victory
All wars are already won
We have been forewarned of hazards
All dangers have been revealed
The Word tells the future
And all that will come about
We must encourage our brothers
And sisters be encouraged as well
It is the least of what we expect
Share our talents with each other




--- Page 123 ---
To aid God in His great work
To deliver more power to us
To share Jesus with all men
Our souls will hunger to deliver
Every word to every man
We will expendiate every strength
Every ounce we have in us
All to do the good cause
Do not do it just for men
For God beats all in priority
We must consider His heart
And place His love in ours
We knock dead all our iniquities
For the room is for only God
He aids our souls from within
Being side by side by Him
We have put to death our desires
And all of our worldly wants
For we deny ourselves everyday
We form a mist of common fragment
A part of the entire scheme
The plot God has planned out well
With every detail in mind
his dreams for us will become real
What He has in store will prevail
So we must seek the depths of our hearts
And acknowledge our conviction’s arrival
To not expect compensation
For doing what God commands
For we are indeed blessed as disciples
And we will continue to be
We shall not grow bored or confused
Or try to take the easier path
For the road is very narrow
And we shall maintain our balance
To not lose grip of the kingdom
And God helps us in that
So finally after we have considered
And remembered what God has prepared
We will appreciate the authenticity of God.




--- Page 124 ---
Poalm 75-100

When we make our final decision
And applied our hearts to the full
We will have an appreciation
Of what God inspired in us
Our friendships will fully be shown
We shall articulate our creativity
For God’s grace, all acquittal from sin
We will aspire to never succumb
To the world’s only lonely intentions
We cease to pass on a useless second
And apply all time for His work
Benevolence quite underestimated
Our grandest view cannot compare
Never natives, but now proud citizens
We are to what God has in store
Keeping our balance right on track
No such pain will make us fall
God has given us all the notes
To the final test that all will take
Perspiring to be prepared and ready
To accept God more when He comes
You must consider every intention
That has appeared in your hearts
Pull out all the deep rooted evil
To be destroyed by God’s holy light
For God indeed can comprehend
All the troubles that plague our minds
So trust that He knows what’s right
His discerning will split spirit and soul
And ever down to greater steps
Precise is the clockwork of God
That controls every second of time
We try to split this down smaller
Not knowing how far we can go
For God can go down so small
That time is time no more




--- Page 125 ---
And such large units can seem infinite to us
But could be just the beat of God’s heart
For what seems so long to us
Is but a mere speck to God
And we stand in awe of a genius
Who does not register on the IQ of Him
How can we measure the infinite
Let us just leave that to God
And spare many mistakes we would make
Many more than we already do
Be pleased that you were chosen
By God who is never wrong
If you ever question this or the Word
Then check your heart to see who is right
For two things like this can’t both be right
Such as God and money don’t compare
And whatever you see as right
Put your whole heart into that
And leave well the other alone
Do not straddle between the two
Because you will fall down on your face
And confusion will clog your mind
As achurch we should see the same
Tn one such mind, a likeness
In which it pertains to all
Yes in Heaven, the phrase will be false:
“It is impossible to please all the people all the time”
For all will have rest in Heaven
And we will give thanks for this
And never question His authority
We shall cherish the gift of God
Always and forever we will
We will sing and glorify Him
Of all praises we have to give
The shackles of sin have been broken
Never to hold on to us again
We have listened to Him at last
And for this we have been healed
Spoken to us from Christians
Disciples who care for lost men




--- Page 126 ---
Among the people of the world
But of it not longer are we
Can I inspire a magical word
Before my words are done
Can I spark but a hint of interest
Of what I have to give
I am limited in what I can speak
By the little allotted time
So let my words be wise
And not squander them with lies
Only valuable words spoken by us
Will be heard by any man
We have chosen this path
To lead others along it
So change each day within
And let out your inner intuition
To spread magic and wonders around
So that all will inherit a place
Within a kingdom so unique
It is a privilege God has given us
Let us not forget His Word
He gave us water to live upon
Spiritual and physical for us
With many powers that heal
For baptism plays a part
In the healing of the soul
For we are not right without God
And all purity can be in Him
Our tongues share the promise
That God has intended for us
A godly vow, no changes
So we will not be deceived
So trust in an eternal God
Believe me, He has been there
Any situation you have been in
God knows what it’s about
So don’t be silent this day and age
Instead be a bold disciple
Share your faith with an eagerness
God has saved you by His grace.

Lord of Heaven and Earth
Let me die for you
Let me cry for you

Power and Glory are
Just the beginning
In your holy realm

So OK

It won’t end when I’m in your Kingdom
I will serve every day through love
I will love my brothers and sisters
Your Word will be spread all across the land.

The time has become for a Kingdom of nations
There will be no time that he is not with us
A word at a time and we’re always giving

A command that we follow to cover the Earth.

Love all the days though we cannot see him
Tithing so dear, our sacrifice we give him
Temptations and traditions will not remove us
Living through faith your love will guide us.

What is this feeling that I hold inside?
I can feel humble, not arrogance or pride
It is sad or scared, but not alone
God has made me whole

HR TE OR OR aS

Weep Mighty One when the righteous have sinned
And pulled your name far from their hearts
When poisoned words fall from their tongues
And they seem alone at once.

Heaven, on Earth it’s our eternal goal
To share our lives all through
Righteousness will come when it’s due
And the world will know the truth.

[faster, more upbeat]
Sing of joy and celebrate
His time about to come
Listen for the sound of God
It will come when his work is done.

I can miss all the lost souls
When God forgives those not lost
Icry, but my tears have all gone
With conviction so deep that it hurts

[fast once more, allegro!]
Wake up and smell the coffee
It’s not too late to be one of us

Always sharing and always caring
Those lives that will never end...

Song 71S-3

All the sins of man thus borne
Upon the King’s great chest
Everlasting love for us
His faith knew endless bounds

He oe oi os ok

Oh, our savior proud and true
Has done everything for me and you
Went from town to town
Through desert near the burning sun

Precious saint who lives in Heaven
Is noble in love and trust
Songs are sung to his great might
And salvation was finally knew

Christians humble in his Word
Our lives are given to Him
Fall to the ground and meditate
Love and praise forevermore

Christ, the superior redeemer
Patience through and though he waits
Restful eyes upon our ways
Bow down until he comes again.

Everlasting Word of God
Shine all around the church
Brother and sister sharing well
Through all the time at hand

FER ROR

Once upon a rock
The church it was begun
Peter led in daring faith
What he realized soon was won

Heavens streets of gold
We sing of lasting grace
Watch us as we celebrate

Behold, the time has come

To hold it in His hand
The lost will soon be free
' Evangelize ‘round the world
We come to him at last

Eternity with God
Our sins redeemed by He
Jesus will articulate
These words will ever last

Song 7S-5

Bring out the pictures
That can resemble God
Who is such trust
In Him consider
What you think of them
It’s hard, try harder
To understand
Why He loves us so

as a a os aie ok

Sing, raise your voices
It is time to share
Expose your weakness
To be healed by them
Sing Hallelujah
Praise Jehovah’s name
It’s awe and wonder
That makes His Church alive

Inside the kingdom
We can dedicate

| To all the wisdom

| And all the like

| We must remember

Who died for us

: And gave his freedom

: So we’d stay alive

Eternity
Is where we’ll be
With Him forever
We can trust in thee.

Thy noble spirit, young and unique
Sing a song of grace for me
How much more must we strive
To see it come for us

ok ok ok ok RK

Eager to make it like
The lives of long ago
Destiny to try and uphold
Our tamest mind of all

We cry for our dear brothers
Who are but one in mind
Sharing of such likeness

Is boldness beyond our view

Be calm on your fine day
Chosen for its unbroken worth
Try not to guess the name
But instead, gain your needed rest.

Soug 7S-7

Stagnant in the world’s eyes
Are men who dare to dream
Threatened with an evil eye
But we can’t hide from that

oe oe oi oe oR

Share your space with a spirit
To tame your understanding
He listens to your every word
That lies between your heart’s beat

Give up your innocence
For once live on the edge
Chase your dreams like the wind
And stare death right through its eyes

Dance for eternity’s days
Speak the magic within your heart
Sound the trumpets of triumph
For we are going home!

Rap with words of wisdom
Chant the names of spirit
Whisper the wind’s message
Symbolically laden bare

Spring into your deepest actions
Harmonize with the willow song
Encourage your mind to learn
To be adventurous for awhile

Translate your destiny’s words
Into understandable songs
So everyone will relate
Move with the flow of wind

Prepare for the intermission
For when it will reach its end
Grasp the echoes around
And save them in a box.

Soug 7S-9

Spare us not the misery
To train our minds for more
Burn them into your mind
To take over and strengthen within

RRR

For a brief instant will be still
All doings and actions around
Synchronize your perceptions
To be in time with the world

Learn of many opinions
Justified solely by men
Wonder toward the answers
Let them drift back to you

Repeat your learning for awhile
To understand the pure note
Distant souls will be found
And shown to everyone.

He is always watching
Share him with the crowds
Shine like the stars we are

With the brilliance of the Sun

Heo a oe oe oe

Speak a song of wisdom
Discerning, truth, and grace
Not faltering in our times
We have been justified by God

What lies beyond the big blue yonder
Valleys to bring the mountains down
A footstep to see us on
Along our tedious path

A Father in which we can trust
To place our life and soul
To wager to the point of death
It can but spark the interest of men.

Soug 7S-Ul

Tired eyes watch the light
Preparing for His arrival
Sing a song of grace for me
Unchain our stubborn hearts

oe oo aR ee

Sting of death, the pain has gone
Our sins of long ago
Pertaining to but every man
Our tears let out our dreams

Reach out and take the gift
The star of another is born
Praise the great Name above
The time has finally come

All suspicions laid to rest
Into the tomb it lays
We have joined a new creation
Disciples, we certainly must.

To Getha:

To a sister a great as you
The truth is spread around
In a humble sense is known
An honest truth is shown
We see all the days these things
And wonder about our ways
Bringing direction to unknown paths
And seemingly so in fact
A treasure, a must to know
Worthy of much to see
You are indeed a treasure
Being worth much more than these
Speak from the heart dear sister
To share your state of mind
Let us know your perceptions
To not stray from the peace of heart

Be prepared in all you do
Knowledge is given by you.

Of Breada, a Poem!

The mirror shows a disciple
When you look for yourself
Many people see this face
But your heart only few can see
Those people indeed are blessed
To see such a humble heart
Such an example you present
The time God has picked well
So show yourself for your worth
You can make a great breakthrough
More changes will come in time
There is so much you can do.

Meditate on your traits
Your mind holds ever so much.

74 Poem of Christina

Your name reminds one of love
The love shown through our savior
In Him was every nation remembered
All knowledge and wisdom He knew
Your voice carries on His tradition
To share this with the crowd
Can praises be timeless, indeed
And hope be restored always
Sing a song of virtuous grace
The morality of men restored.

Wisdom does lie in your heart,
Time shall see you well.

For Dioune:

Patience, a virtue of you
To believe in rightly ones
Faith I share truly with you
Your peace shines like the sun
Warm smiles fill the air
Your song rides the wind
An amazing sister you are
To be so fired up indeed
Goodness has filled your heart
Your love for God does show
Rise up you will in time
Your presence is already known
Humbly I ask for forgiveness of you
To miss such a favorable time
I wish to make it special to you
A date most sincerely planned
What you need, just ask me
If you wish anything done
Please take to heart this message
I missed the best time of all.

Time is never-ever the same
You make it special each day.

To Sister Deouue:

Soft whispers in the misty air
Green emeralds clear as ice
Forests of warm lullaby
Trueness glows all around
Take the chance in a book
Read some words of wonder
Share the magic all around
Many deeds are done
A cat purrs happily in your lap
The comfort drifts off to sleep
Dreams of warm fuzzy things
Cute, humble, and very keen
The adventure grows within you
As you turn the pages
Learning something really new
A trip to your imagination
Leave this world from your mind
To go deep into stories abroad
Seek the majesty of what is called
To know how much it’s worth.

Candlelight in starry night
Behold the peace of it.




--- Page 143 ---
Times to know of these good days
And even though we care
So much is done through us
And you do truly care
Seeming so for every day
Upon the rocks of stone
Never to try to retake
Our tasks done long ago
You a sister have cared
You have done much more
No limits to how much you care
To what you know and say
Joyful and exciting it is
To know how much to say
Believe me when I tell you this
A great sister you are indeed!

Times are tough through the days
Singing and praise does work

To Deoune

Double dates are filled with magic
There is so much to do
Not depending on if late or early
Preparedness goes into each one
Concerned about everyone
Giving to each other
Plans were made a week in advance
On what there was to do
We learn more about one another
From time spent doing good
Encouragement brought together
From the fullness of our hearts
Singing songs of virtue
Honesty and grace
Everlasting in procession
We advance the kingdom by step

Benevolence is evermore shared
Our hearts show this spiritual form.

To Stster Elaine

Your spirit shines with incredible light
Your guiding light will show the way
Listen for a moment to the peaceful night
The truth is what God called us to say
Your humble heart is warm inside
A great peace is most pleasantly shown
Our lives will be lived by his side
When you enter a room your presence is known
Remember his good and have faith as well
What I know is what I tell.

I know the truth;
It is all that I tell

To Gloria:

Sacred songs and stones
A temple of such glory
Praising Him in the highest
His glory given to thee

Such a date, so impromptu
And many friendships spread
To encourage one another
In such an atmosphere

Training our minds in time
Together we explored the world
Blessed be God for the time we shared
And from such came wonderful news

At once we have shook the rhythm
Night-felt winds presented the scene.

To Yoanue

Praising, it is always timeless
Flower petals and sweet smiles
Warm sunshine and a good book
Entering into your favorite world
Forever, your will be done
Ask and expect it from God
He has made a promise to us
And your faith will make it true
Envision yourself in Heaven

Behold your humbled heart
Such a sister, so deserving
So encouraging indeed are you
So once again remember Jesus
And what He’s done for you
His love is shown from this
So we can do much through Him

See a sign of shining grace
His best has come for all.

You have the talent for expressing yourself
Your time all patiently and delicately spent
Appraisal of the finest inspector there was
Would surely find awe in the work you do
You easily come up with solutions
And works of art are:created by you
You triumph many times from this
The work of your hands always shows
And for once you can see your talent
From the fruits of your creations
Though it may seem recreation
Surely the work of one who cared

Spared none in your dedication
Your work gets its just rewards.

Will come back so strong
And you will remember the peace.
