# 💾 FurryOS Persistence Guide

## What Is Persistence?

**Persistence** = Your changes, files, and settings **save between reboots** without installing to hard drive!

---

## 🎯 Two Modes Available

### Mode 1: Ephemeral (Default)
```
Boot → Use FurryOS → Reboot
Everything resets. Like Tails OS.

✅ Perfect for:
• Privacy/security
• Testing
• Clean slate every time
```

### Mode 2: Persistent  
```
Boot → Use FurryOS → Save files → Reboot → Boot again
Files and settings persist!

✅ Perfect for:
• Daily use from USB
• Keeping your work
• Settings that stick
• Never installing to hard drive
```

---

## 📊 How It Works

### USB Drive Layout After Setup:

```
Your USB Drive (e.g., 32GB):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Partition 1: FurryOS System (2GB)  │ ← The OS (read-only)
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Partition 2: EFI Boot (512MB)      │ ← Bootloader
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Partition 3: Persistence (29GB)    │ ← YOUR DATA (read/write)
│                                     │   • Files you create
│                                     │   • Settings you change
│                                     │   • Apps you install
│                                     │   • Everything persists here!
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎯 Boot Menu Explained

When you boot from USB, you see:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║   🐾 FurryOS 8.0.0-origin 🐾        ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════╣
║ 1. FurryOS Live (Ephemeral)         ║ ← Nothing saved
║ 2. FurryOS Live (Persistent) ★      ║ ← Changes saved
║ 3. FurryOS Live (Failsafe)          ║ ← Safe mode
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

Use ↑↓ arrows to select, Enter to boot
```

### Which Mode Should You Choose?

**Ephemeral (Mode 1):**
- First boot (before setup)
- Testing something risky
- You want a clean slate
- Maximum privacy

**Persistent (Mode 2):**
- After running setup-persistence.sh
- Daily use
- You want to keep your files
- Settings should stick

## 📝 What Gets Saved (Persistent Mode)

### ✅ Saved Between Reboots:
- Files in /home/
- Desktop icons and wallpaper
- Browser bookmarks and history
- Application settings
- Installed packages (apt install)
- Network WiFi passwords
- Custom configurations

### ❌ NOT Saved (Both Modes):
- Nothing in /tmp/
- RAM contents
- Kernel state

---

## 🔍 Check Your Mode

Run this anytime to see which mode you're in:

```bash
/furryos/scripts/persistence-status.sh
```

Output in Ephemeral mode:
```

## 🗑️ Reset Persistence (Start Fresh)

If you want to wipe all saved data:

```bash
/furryos/scripts/reset-persistence.sh

# WARNING: This deletes EVERYTHING in persistence!
# You'll be asked to confirm
```

## 💡 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Daily Driver (No Installation)

```
1. Write ISO to USB
2. Run setup-persistence.sh
3. Always boot to "Persistent" mode
4. Use FurryOS like it's installed
5. Your Debian 13 is never touched!
```

### Scenario 2: Testing/Privacy (Like Tails)

```
1. Write ISO to USB
2. Don't run setup-persistence.sh
3. Always boot to "Ephemeral" mode
4. Everything resets on reboot
5. Maximum privacy
```

### Scenario 3: Hybrid (Best of Both)

```
1. Write ISO to USB
2. Run setup-persistence.sh
3. Boot to "Persistent" for daily use
4. Boot to "Ephemeral" for private browsing
5. Choose at boot menu!
```

## 🎯 Advantages Over Installing

| **Aspect** | **Installed to Hard Drive** | **Persistent USB** |
|------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Debian 13 | ❌ Replaced or dual-boot | ✅ Completely untouched |
| Risk | 🔴 High | 🟢 Zero |
| Portable | ❌ No | ✅ Yes - use on any PC! |
| Reversible | ⚠️ Hard to undo | ✅ Just unplug USB |
| Speed | ⚡ Fast (SSD) | 🐢 Slower (USB) |
| Testing | 🔴 Risky | 🟢 Completely safe |

---

## ⚡ Performance Notes

### USB Speed Matters:
- **USB 2.0**: Usable but slow (~30 MB/s)
- **USB 3.0**: Good performance (~100 MB/s) ✅ Recommended
- **USB 3.1/3.2**: Best performance (~500+ MB/s)

### Tips for Better Performance:
1. Use USB 3.0 or faster drive
2. Use high-quality USB drive (not cheap ones)
3. Keep free space on persistence partition
4. Consider USB flash drive vs. external SSD

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Persistence partition not found"
```bash
# Check if partition exists:
lsblk

# If missing, run setup again:
/furryos/scripts/setup-persistence.sh
```

### "Changes aren't saving"
```bash
# Make sure you booted to Persistent mode:
/furryos/scripts/persistence-status.sh

# Should show: "Persistence is ACTIVE"
# If not, reboot and select option 2
```

### "USB drive is full"
```bash
# Check space:
df -h | grep persistence

# Delete old files or reset:
/furryos/scripts/reset-persistence.sh
```
