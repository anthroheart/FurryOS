# 🎉 COMPLETE ISO WITH SOURCE CODE & MIGRATION TOOL

## ✅ What I Created

### 1. **furryos-migrate.sh** [code_file:106]
**Migration tool for persistent→full install**

**Save to:** `/TOP/assets/furryos-migrate.sh`

**Features:**
- Mode 1: Backup persistent USB data
- Mode 2: Restore to full installation
- Mode 3: Auto-migrate (both in one step)
- Backs up: /home, configs, packages, ANTHROHEART playlists
- Creates tarball for easy transfer
- Restores everything to full install

**Usage:**
```bash
# On persistent USB:
sudo /furryos/scripts/furryos-migrate.sh
# Choose option 1 (Backup)

# On full install:
sudo /furryos/scripts/furryos-migrate.sh
# Choose option 2 (Restore)
```

## 🔐 Security

### **Private Key Protection:**
```python
# Triple-checked exclusion:
1. Not copied in ignore_patterns
2. Manually removed after copy (double-check)
3. Final verification before ISO completion

# Result:
✅ Private key stays on build machine
✅ Only public key in ISO
✅ Users can verify signatures but cannot create fake ones
```

### **What Users Get:**
- ✅ Public key (`furryos_signing.pub`)
- ✅ Signed binaries (already signed)
- ✅ Verification script
- ❌ Private key (NEVER included)
