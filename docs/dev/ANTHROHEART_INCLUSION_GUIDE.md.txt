## 🚀 How To Build

### If You Have ANTHROHEART.7z File:

```bash
cd /TOP

# Install 7z if needed
sudo apt-get install p7zip-full

# Extract ANTHROHEART.7z (if not already extracted)
7z x ANTHROHEART.7z

# Should create /TOP/ANTHROHEART/ folder

# Verify it exists
ls -lh ANTHROHEART/

# Build ISO with ANTHROHEART included
./quick_start.sh

# The script will:
# 1. Detect ANTHROHEART folder
# 2. Copy entire folder to ISO (10-20 min)
# 3. Build ~10 GB ISO
```

### Auto-Extract Feature:

The updated deploy_iso.py will:
1. Check for `/TOP/ANTHROHEART/` folder
2. If not found, look for `/TOP/ANTHROHEART.7z`
3. Auto-extract if found
4. Build ISO with contents
