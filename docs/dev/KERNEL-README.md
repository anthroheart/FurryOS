## 1. Get the Live (not Netinstaller) Debian 13/MATE ISO!

## 2. MOUNT THE ISO: 'mount' command or however.

## 3. Extract these Kernel/FS files to a '/kernel' subfolder (~3.3GB): filesystem.squashfs, vmlinuz, initrd.img

## 4. Or use your preferred Kernels, maybe even Windows 7.

## The files in this /kernel folder are placeholders (made with 'touch').

# You can download the live ISOs from Debian:
