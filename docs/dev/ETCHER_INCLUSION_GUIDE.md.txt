# 🔥 BalenaEtcher Inclusion Feature

## What This Does

**BalenaEtcher AppImage is now included INSIDE the FurryOS ISO!**

This means anyone who boots FurryOS can:
- ✅ Create MORE FurryOS USB drives from within the live system
- ✅ Share The Origin with others without downloading anything
- ✅ No internet required - everything is self-contained
- ✅ One USB can create many USBs!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### During Build:
```
1. deploy_iso.py downloads BalenaEtcher AppImage (once)
2. Saves to /TOP/assets/ (persists for future builds)
3. Includes it in the ISO at /furryos/tools/
4. Creates launcher script: /furryos/scripts/write-to-usb.sh
5. Documents in README.md
```

### Inside ISO:
```
furryos/
├── bin/
│   ├── heartbeat_core
│   └── metadata_wrangler
├── images/
│   └── icon.png
├── scripts/
│   ├── setup-persistence.sh      ← Setup persistence
│   ├── persistence-status.sh     ← Check status
│   └── write-to-usb.sh           ← NEW! Launch BalenaEtcher
├── tools/                         ← NEW!
│   └── balenaEtcher-1.19.25-x64.AppImage  (~105 MB)
└── README.txt                     ← Updated with instructions
```

### When Someone Boots FurryOS:
```bash
# They run this simple command:
/furryos/scripts/write-to-usb.sh

# BalenaEtcher GUI opens
# They can create MORE FurryOS USB drives!
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### Inside FurryOS Live Mode:

```bash
# Open terminal

# Option 1: Use launcher script (easiest)
/furryos/scripts/write-to-usb.sh

# Option 2: Run AppImage directly
/furryos/tools/balenaEtcher-1.19.25-x64.AppImage

# BalenaEtcher GUI opens
# User interface:
# ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
# │    balenaEtcher                    │
# ├────────────────────────────────────┤
# │ [Flash from file]                  │

## 🔧 What Gets Created

### In /TOP/assets/ (Persists):
```
/TOP/assets/
├── launcher.py
├── deploy_iso.py                         ← Updated
├── balenaEtcher-1.19.25-x64.AppImage    ← NEW! Saved here
└── ...
```

**Once downloaded, never downloaded again!** Future ISO builds reuse it.

### In ISO:
```
/furryos/
├── tools/
│   └── balenaEtcher-1.19.25-x64.AppImage  ← 105 MB
└── scripts/
    └── write-to-usb.sh                     ← Launcher

## ⚡ Quick Commands

### Build ISO with BalenaEtcher included:
```bash
cd /TOP
# Replace deploy_iso.py first!
./quick_start.sh

# BalenaEtcher will be downloaded and included automatically
# Saved to /TOP/assets/ for reuse
```

### Use from within FurryOS:
```bash
# After booting FurryOS from USB:
/furryos/scripts/write-to-usb.sh

# Or directly:
/furryos/tools/balenaEtcher-1.19.25-x64.AppImage
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "AppImage won't run"
```bash
# Make it executable
chmod +x /furryos/tools/balenaEtcher-1.19.25-x64.AppImage

# Run it
/furryos/tools/balenaEtcher-1.19.25-x64.AppImage
```

### "Download failed during build"
```bash
# ISO will still be created without BalenaEtcher
# User can download it separately if needed

# Or manually download to /TOP/assets/:
cd /TOP/assets
wget https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases/download/v1.19.25/balenaEtcher-1.19.25-x64.AppImage
chmod +x balenaEtcher-1.19.25-x64.AppImage

# Rebuild - will use existing file
cd /TOP
./quick_start.sh
```

### "ISO too large for CD"
```bash
# Modern use: USB drives (not CDs!)
# 605 MB fits on any 1GB+ USB
# Use BalenaEtcher to write to USB
```
